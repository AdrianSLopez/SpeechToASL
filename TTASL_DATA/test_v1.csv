7,as well as be a portrayal of a lesbian love story FIRE be also a comic satire of middle class indian culture I find this be a quality which be little appreciated about the movie these two genre ie deep meaningful alternative love story and comic satire usually mix together just as well as oil and water do but Mehta somehow manage to achieve the balance to near perfection the servant Jatin s behaviour the family s treatment of he the bedridden grandmother be constant inescapable presence Ashok s obsession with a swami s teaching come from a culture much like India s these be thing I can immediately identify as be typical they have be cry out to be point out and ridicule while develop her primary subject matter Mehta manage to achieve this secondary theme skillfully in fact much of the humour in the film which provide essential relief from the heavy subject of taboo lesbian love and gender issue stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary the film flow from the comic to the serious with great subteltybr br all in all brilliant use of symbolic device Radha compare to Sita of legend and come out of Fire unscathed and therefore pure the lifelong desire of the young Radha to

8,easily one of the good indian film ever grant that be not say muchI make this conclusion after a whopping 15 minute of watching but I can truly say that Fire be also one of the really beautiful and brilliant film I have seenbr br beautiful because of its imagery the good example I can give be the parallelism between the 2 female leadsradha and Sita and the character of the same name in Hindu mythology Sita for example be the wife of the revere Lord Ram as legend go Ram subjugate his wife by make she walk through a Fire to prove her purity Sita in response cry and leave he reunite with she motherthe Earth this story have all sort of crazy link to the story of the 2 indian womennandita Das and Shabana Azmi the word Fire all of a sudden have many meaning marriage tradition religion motherhood and probably a few other I do not catchbr br brilliant because of its social overtone many who be offend by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see Fireeg my mom who actually love it why because although Fire be an attack on tradition it be also an attack on tradition in other word that be its strength not its weakness traditional conservative social moreswhether indian or canadian or american or whatever be useless if they enslave you gender role and self denial can both do thisbr br these be the thing I take with I after see Fire hat off to Deepa Mehta,"[[4,

9,the movie be really about choice in the oppress state of affair as see in Fire where good woman have to be obedient and do what be correct in the eye of tradition there seem few option for Radha and Sita however grant that it be not their only option what be life without desire Radha question Ashok yes it be true that life provide we with a number of option but how many we can take depend on a number of external factor when your world be confine to a small indian household be a dutiful daughter in law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch a dutiful wife of 13 year to a man who have take a vow of celibacy due to your not be able to have a child a man who only want you lie next to he to prove his strength in eliminate his desire I feel the lady have little choice but to find solace in each other s company I guess the fact that so many woman applaud Ms Mehta s work be because it provide they with an option to think for themselves an option to do what be perhaps unacceptable the lesbian scene I feel be merely to put that point across every scene in the movie from the first at the Taj Mahal to the last at the Mosque be etch in my mind how frustrating to be a prisoner of your feeling and desire to feel that you have to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it be expect of you to have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch what then be the meaning of our existence one wonder in the scene where Sita be cry alone in the room and Radha come in to comfort she their lip accidentally brush against each other and it awaken a feeling in they something they have both be deprive ofbr br Bravo to Ms Mehta in translate her vision so clearly I especially like the flashback to the young Radha try to see for the ocean it be a metaphor for freedom freedom to choose freedom to transport ourselves to place we would normally be unable to reach in those scene it be gently tell to we that her sense of duty have also be pass down from her mother who I assume live within the rich indian tradition of duty in marriage the movie be beautifully film and enhance by the musical score by AR Rahman since the film I have become ardent fan of the two lead actress and the director I look forward to more of Ms Deepa s future production,"[[19, 7, 4], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [1, 4], [17, 4, 0, 11, 11, 24], [0, 1, 14, 20,

21,I finally watch the third film in Mehta s trilogy fire to begin I would say that water be the unquestionable masterpiece on all level Fire come next with Earth close behind in order of quality fire there be so much go on in this film that I will need a few more viewing to drink it all in the writing be superb the script create friction that start the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really do erupt into a fire the conflict move into complete rupture of relationship br br Mehta be one brave lady she see with a clear eye much that be jaundice false and repressive about the great society from which she come from India be rapidly change these day but much of this be economic change that she meet with such ferocious opposition to the making of water after having have the script clear show that there be still many taboo subject which indian people more than less can not look squarely in the face can not examine or discuss they bad if someone like Mehta have the courage to hold up a mirror to these issue she face death threat so as much as India think of itself as a pluralistic tolerant society the fact be not always so whereas earth be merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence Fire and Water be point at personal social and religious issue which as I say be consider so strongly in a negative sense that an open artistic dialog be still many year away as I write this water be schedule to actually be show in India later this year I will believe it when I see it br br Fire confront a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I see in a price above ruby whether it be arrange marriage which it use to be like among Jews about 150 year ago or like it be among many modern Indians they have the risk

tight than Kenny Rogers orange face lift my concern briefly bristle at Kutcher s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort be make to paint he as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglass a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk that would make George Clooney proud yeah we get it I be totally ready to hate himbr br but then he have to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force I to soften my jab br br Darn you ape man efficiently mix tense exciting rescue scene drama humor and solid acting the Guardian be easily a film that I dare say the majority of audience will enjoy you can quibble about its clichs predictability and rare moment of overcooked sappiness but none of that take away from the entertainment valuebr br I have a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner start train the young guy but on the contrary the training session just might be the most interesting aspect of the film Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers be hero whose story have never really be portray on the big screen so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it be to make it be very informative and a great way to introduce audience to this under appreciated groupbr br Do you have what it take to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous mission in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while try to help strand panic people who be depend on you for their survival and if all that be not bad enough sometimes you can not save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who live and who diesbr br Man who want all that responsibility not I I have no idea what it be really like for these guy and who would have think I would have an Ashton Kutcher Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education br br Not only do the Guardian do a great job of pay tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for we it also do a good job of entertain its pay customersbr br THE GIST br br moviegoer want an inside look at what it be like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the Guardian a chance I see it for free but have I pay I would ve feel I have get my money s worth,"[[8], [1, 4], [11, 14, 14, 10], [5, 14, 17, 22, 0, 17, 3], [19, 14], [19, 7, 4], [6, 20, 0, 17,

24,now I do understand that this film be not mean as an indictment against all Indians but it be an amazing film because it dare to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have concern their woman and sexuality I have know for some time that sexism be very common in this society with woman be murder because the husband s family do not want they any more after his death or because she have a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetus because they be see as a curse instead of a blessing I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offend by the film but the bottom line be that there be some truth to the subject matter even if the film be so strongly attack when it debut in India a decade ago as a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most western audience member will be shock or at least be emotionally pull into the plight of the lady in this filmbr br Although I be a male be not rabidly feminist and I be straight the film have a strong positive impact on I and it be not an agenda film that can only be enjoy by Lesbians and man hater in fact I do not think the film be promote hatred of man or homosexuality but instead give a credibly argument how in the case of these two lady it be the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husband yes I use the word wicked and mean it as both husband live in this large household be intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouse sexuality in many traditional society this be indeed the case and woman be doom to an empty emotional existencebr br One husband marry a vivacious young woman Sita out of family obligation this arranged marriage be uncomfortable for they both but in the beginning Sita make an attempt to connect with her sullen husband however he see himself as a victim and could have care less about Sita and he continue to have an affair with a liberal minded chinese lady to make matter worse he do nothing to hide the affair and make no apology in their dead marriage sex be purely mean to produce child and there be no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional need meet and unfortunately he could have care lessbr br Another husband be married to a lady who be infertile Radha oddly after initially try to have child they have go the next 13 year without any sexual contact whatsoever it be because this man have decide to become an ascetic ie in Hinduism a person who give up the pleasure of the world to gain inner enlightenment now his wanting to do this be all well and good if he be not already marry and have obligation for his wife however be marry this be an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assume his wife have no sexual feeling nor do he seem to care the close he would allow she to he sexually be to sleep next to he as have she next to he help teach himself to overcome the desire of the flesh this must have bring nothing but frustration to herbr br So you have get two neglected and normal woman live in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual need eventually these need bring these sister in law together at first just emotionally but later sexually as well the movie be brilliant how it get I to look at and understand how in some case homosexuality be inevitable and even healthy compare to a life of emotional desolationbr br late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship be discover it lead to a not totally unexpected reaction from Radha s enlighten husband a man who seek religious insight and peace yet be so wrap up in himself that true insight and growth be impossiblebr br this be a very challenging and adult film while there be very little nudity the subject matter be very adult and this be not a film to show your kid very disturbing indeed be one minor character who masturbate in front of an old paralyzed lady as I say this be not a film to let your kid watch however for a mature audience this be an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to thinkbr br The film feature good act complex character excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which I find rewarding the only serious negative I can not blame on the movie itself but on the idiot who release this on videotape this be because although the movie be in English the accent be quite strong at time and it be not always easy to understand what be be say but and this be the bad part there be no closed or open caption include they be a must for western audience if you do watch this film see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a new release on video will have captioning mine sure didntbr br By the way director Deepa Mehta a popular female director have make several other wonderful film such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD Hollywood a consistent theme in her film be the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectation and Westernism with a strong emphasis on female character not surprisingly this West thinking lady make her home in Canada and be divorce a truly unusual woman to say the least for a similar film that explore traditional culture meet western culture try another canadian gem

25,overall a well do movie there be the part that make I wince and there be the part that I throw my hand up at but I come away with something more than I go in withbr br i think the movie suffer from some serious excess ambition without spoil it let I say that the obvious reference to the trial by fire in Ramayana be way beyond what this movie stand for the Ramayana be an epic not a 200 page book that put down woman in India the movie be about two girl marry into a very distinctive indian family while the basic tenet of the unwritten law of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative India let I assure my reader that I having live in Delhi for 12 year find entire part that just do not ring those bell I mean some thing and some action be very true but some other stuff be just way off the mark especially todaybr br Delhi be complicated India be complicated the director try to simplify both and fail pretty miserably at thatbr br why in English can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English or the French speak in English seriously jarring even the servant speak in fluent accented English albeit with a hint of colloquialism in the language for believabilitybr br But the chemistry between the lead be palpable if you like it hot this be a movie for you I think that be the big saving grace the development of a true real life love storybr br if this film be about Radha and Sita then it would have get full mark from I and in be about they it could have make a subtle statement but this movie go out there to say this be what India be and this be what indian society be like and in that respect it succeed as much as it fail just take everything you see with a pinch of salt the dark secret of India be not be reveal just two girl be fall in love just like it happen everywhere else,"[[14, 21, 4, 17, 0, 11, 11], [0], [22, 4, 11, 11], [3, 14], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [19, 7, 4, 17, 4], [1, 4], [19, 7, 4], [15, 0, 17, 19], [19, 7, 0, 19], [12, 0, 10, 4], [8],

27,this be a great film in every sense of the word it tackle the subject of tribadism in a society that be quite intolerant of any deviation from the norm it criticise a great many indian custom that many find oppressive such as the arranging of marriage by other the importance of status and face religious hypocrisy sexism the valuation of woman in term of their baby make capacity the bind concept of duty and so on at the heart of the film be a touching love story that go beyond such limitation of the society which the two protagonist find themselves the film be well act and genuine completely believable from begin to end unlike most Bollywood flick the main fault of the film as I see it be first that the two lover seem draw to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they be stick in dead end marriage with no passion and no reward this may play a part in the sexual awakening of the character but most people stick in the same situation will not turn homosexual it seem clear from the beginning of the film that the two character be quite heterosexual when Radha do her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok she make it quite clear that without desire she be dead and the implication be that if he have desire so he could have fulfil she quite completely and also when Sita seem very disappointed when her husband seem to not like she such situation do not turn people into homosexual they may seek comfort in other in the same position but inthe film it be not at all make clear that they be lesbian from the beginning quite the opposite some people be bisexual it be true but most tend to be either hetero or homosexual in the case of the lady in the film both have insensitive jerk for husband if this have not be the case would they have naturally find the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have consider the film ignore this the other fault be the naming of the character the name Sita and Radha seem contrive deliberately to shock and outrage imagine a film in America depict a gay relationship between a man name Jesus and another name Paul by use name associate with various Hindoo scripture the film be strong enough to stand on its own and need no such device in my opinion at any rate the fault do not take much away from the power of the movie it be indeed a very touching and powerful story the image and character will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [0], [6, 17, 4, 0, 19], [5, 8, 11, 12], [8,

28,this be my first Deepa Mehta film I see the film on tv in its Hindi version with its Sita character present as Nita I also note that it be Radha who undergo the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita Sita yet what I love about the film be its screenplay by Ms Mehta not her direction the character big and small be well develop and seem quixotic towards the end somewhat like the end of Mazursky s an Unmarried Woman they be brave woman surround by cardboard man and one cardboard man Ashok seem to come alive in the last shot we see of he carry his invalid mother Biji he seem to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion br br Ms Mehta seem to fumble as a director however compare to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she can not use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she be present except present a glimpse of the chinese micro minority in the social milieu of India she even dedicate the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her Radha reminesce of halcyon day with both her parent in a mustard field compare she to Mrinal Sen Adoor Gopalakrishnan Muzaffar Ali and she be dwarf by these giant give her competent canadian production team and financial resource Mehta s film of two bisexual lady in an indian middle class household may be sacrilege to some but merely capture the atrophy of middle class home that do not seem to aspire for something well than its immediate survival in a limited social space Kannada Malayalam and Bengali film have touch parallel theme in India but do not have the publicity that surround this film and therefore have not be see by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoersbr br Ms Das Ms Azmi Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda be credible but not outstanding Ms Azmi be a talented actress who give superb performance under good director Mrinal Sen s Khandar Gautam Ghose s Paar Benegal s Ankur a brilliance notably absent in this film Ms Das sparkle due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability all in all the film s strength remain in the structure of the screenplay which be above average in term of international cinema I be sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talent in her future screenplay,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [12, 24], [5, 8, 17, 18, 19], [3, 4, 4, 15, 0], [12, 4, 7, 19, 0], [5, 8, 11,

38,this have be edit for spacebr br chan wook Park s new film be a complex film that be not easy to classify nominally a horror movie the central character be a vampire the film actually have element of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion and its analog of viral invasion of a body romance and few other thing as well it be a film that have almost too much on its mind the film take its own matter and mix they with classic european literature in this case Emile Zola s Thrse Raquin it be an odd mix that do not always gel but none the less have an incredible power here it be almost 24 hour since I see the film at Lincoln Center with a post film discussion by the director and I find my cage be increasingly rattle its not so much what happen be bothersome its more that its wide reach story and its theme ring a lot of bell in retrospectbr br the plot of the film have a will love priest decide that the good way to help mankind be to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease infect with the disease he eventually succumb and die but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood its not explain he actually survive hail as a miracle worker the priest return to the hospital where he have be minister to the sick unfortunately all be not well the priest find that he need blood to survive he also find that he have all of the typical problem of a vampire and its no not possible for he to go out during the day thing become even more complicated when he becomes reacquaint with a childhood friend and his family the priest some of his animal passion awaken becomes take with the wife of his friend from there it all go sidewaysbr br An ever change film this be a story that spin through a variety of genre as it tell the very human story of a man who find that his life have be radically alter by a chance event and find that he be no long who he think he be it be a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film be forever evolve into something else its also a film that have a great deal on its mind and the theme its playing with be constantly be explore in a variety of way br br The film have enough go on that one could and people probably will write book discuss the filmbr br The two of the strong part of the film be its vampiric element and its romance the vampire part of the tale be brilliant there be something about how it lay out the ground rule and the nature of the affliction that make such perfect sense that it kind of push the old vampire idea aside sit in the theater last night I find myself amazed at how impressed how well it work I think the fact that it play more or less straight be what be so earth shake here be a vampire who just want to have a normal life it be contrast with what happen later it make clear that live an existence of hunt human really be not go to work its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys rather its something else I personally think that the film change the play field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible the sequence where the power kick in be just way cool the romance be also wonderfully handle sure the sex scene be steamy and well do but it be the other stuff the look the talk the gesture outside of the sex that make this special I love the look the quiet stare as the forbid couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspect and the mad passion of possible consummation this be one of the great screen romance of all time it perfectly capture the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust if you have ever love deeply I be guess you will find some part of your hear on screen I know I do the statement I just want to spend eternity with you have a sad poignancy to it it be both a statement of what be the intention as well as the depth of emotion the tragic romance will break your heart br br I will not lie to you and say that the film be perfect and great its not as good as the piece be and almost all of they be great especially the actor who I have unjustly fail to hail as amazing the whole do not always come together the various genre thematic element and tone occasionally grate against each other frequently I be wonder where the film be go I hang in there even though the film seem to be wander about aimlesslybr br i like the film a great deal I love the piece more than the film as a whole its be ping around in my head since I see it and I be guess that it will do so for several day more like or love be irrelevant since this be a film that really should be see since it have so much go on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for day afterward one of the meatiest and most fill film of the year,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [7, 0, 21, 4], [1, 4], [4, 3, 8, 19], [5, 14, 17], [18, 15, 0, 2, 4, 1, 17], [1, 17], [2, 7, 0, 13], [22, 14, 14, 10], [15, 0, 17, 10],

39,the cinematography be the film s shine feature Park really know his stuff when it come to shoot memorable scene from behind a camera every shot be fill with vibrant color that leap off of the screen every frame of the film seem to tell a story all on its own I hope there be a Blu ray release of this film because it will look fantastic it be rather intriguing to see which element of the vampire mythology Park use for his vision Sang hyeon have to drink blood to survive and to stay look flawless have incredible strength and be vulnerable to sunlight he do not however have fang and also have a reflection in the mirrorbr br Although I have never see the film I could not help but feel like this be Chan wook Park s version of Twilight the entire middle portion of the film be devoted to Sang hyeon s and Tae Joo s love for one another it feel like the adult version of Twilight really there be a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenity throw in for good measure maybe it be the Chan Wook Park fanboy in I but I honestly feel like I can guarantee that this be the well film of the two the psychological aspect that I love about Park s previous film be in Thirst as well that be a major factor for I as any film that cause I to think or be unusual in any way wind up become a fan favorite the soundtrack to Park s film always seem to fit its respective film like a glove thirst be no exception while the soundtrack be a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlesslybr br The middle portion of the film do seem to drag on long than everything else in the film it be weird though as the scene during that time be crucial to the storyline of the film and it be hard to imagine Thirst be the same film if any of those scene be cut nevertheless it be my one nitpick of the filmbr br chan wook Park bite into the vampire mythology with Thirst and put his own dark psychological twist on it Park s film always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the follow great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist that will mess with your head and a memorable ending thirst deliver on all front and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserve during its theatrical run on dvd and eventually Blu ray hopefully,"[[19, 7, 4], [2, 8, 13, 4, 12, 0, 19, 14, 6, 17, 0, 15, 7, 24],

and rightfully lack any glamorous moment in comparison to Twilight having view Chan wook Park s precede Oldboy I have very high expectation of Bakjwibr br I anticipate some awkward plot sequence with our anti hero know as Priest Sang hyeon and be very impressed by his performance as a holy man who be force into this quandary of be humane and obey his thirst as a vampire SPOILER after the initial premise of he survive the defective blood transfusion he start to crave blood and discover his super strength and his fly ability the screen shot do his transition phase without overbear on exposition he start drink the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanize for moral reason the oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest have with the manipulative Tae joo be very riveting as they be play by the Host s Kanh ho Song and actress OK vin Kim the special effect be properly place in the backdrop and while it do not offer anything new in the way of stunt and CGI it do not impose itself into the plot drive and character develop premise the story and the pivotal plot point be very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own korean style br br There be not many negative I can say about Bakjwi sometimes I ask myself if the priest transition phase could have show more of the priest have an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have make the movie 3 hour long the movie be long to begin with on the same token vampire really do not have much in the way of express emotion to begin with as mention before this movie be very tragic so do not expect anything hopeful while watch this br br Overall Bakjwi be delightfully dark morbid and original I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewer who be past the teenage phase of Twilight this be definitely the korean answer to the Swedish let the right one In which be also a good movie,"[[19, 7, 4], [3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 8, 19, 8, 14, 13], [14, 5], [0], [21, 0, 12, 15, 8, 17, 4], [1, 4], [0,

be fight and a bat just can not seem to take a side and it try to play both side to his advantage mammal and bird find out what this bat have be do and banish the bat out of their land at the end of

play both side her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seek vampire adventure etc will not ruin too much u have to watch the film and this theme be beautifully present on a plate with delicious side of romance sex violence religion dark comedy tragedy vengeance you name itbr br i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film be very fresh and new something that I have not

47,we all know what Chan wook Park can do if you have not see oldboyor the sympathy trilogy for that matter you be miss out on some of the good film make this century but I be not here to talk about they I be here to talk about thirstbr br this movie be not what you would expect yes it be a vampire movie but at the same time it be also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl I will not get into the synopsisyou can read that above but instead tell you what this movie have to offer Chan wook Park be a master of cinematography and this movie be no exception with some very surreal scene back by intense lighting he set the mood perfectly in almost every scene the movie do start a bit slow but I feel this be necessary to build a relationship with the character once thing start move along it almost never let up until the credit roll Thirst be predominantly a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead character be very intense but at the same time almost disturbing Chan wook Park be no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touch on taboo almost as much as oldboy the end scene be by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the good conclusion to a film I have seenbr br Overall this be an exceptional film that I feel all movie buff should see it be an excitingand admittedly different take on the world of vampire and the romance be far from sappy or boring this movie be gritty selfless and beautiful in all the wrong way obviously it be not for everyone but chance be if you be read this review you be already interested see it do not hesitate,"[[22, 4], [0, 11, 11], [10, 13, 14, 22], [22, 7, 0, 19], [2, 7, 0, 13], [22, 14, 14, 10], [15, 0, 17, 10], [2, 0, 13], [3,

48,I be the first to recognize that Chan wook Park s Thirst be exceptionally well make but spend over two hour with Tae jooOK vin kimis enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time Sang hyeonKang ho songis a priest desire to volunteer for experimental study on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injection concern a specific virus which kill infectiously instead of legitimately die Hyeon become a vampire always yearn for the sustenance blood give for he to fight off an infectious disease which return cause the symptom which flat line he to begin with bump sore and the body vomit blood Sunlight as be know in the vampire genre cause torturous death if expose to Hyeon for a length of time Hyeon fall in lust with Tae joo the wife of sickly childhood friend Kang wooha kyun Shin Tae joo be take in by Mrs RaHae sook Kim regard as a puppy and practically use as a domestic animal to be order around Ta joo be miserable in this situation and begin a torrid affair she instigate with Hyeon soon manipulate he into perhaps kill Kang woo by have he believe she be a victim of abuse renounce his priesthood Hyeon dive headlong into the relationship with Tae joo soon a willing participant in kill Kang woo this incident which Tae woo contribute to use a boat in the middle of a lake both proceed to bury he underwater Tae woo keep he Kang woo from re surface as he attempt to re enterwill haunt both as circumstance arise with Kang woo missingHyeon get rid of he where police would not find his corpse soon Mrs Ra suffer a stroke though one finger and the ability to blink her eye contribute mightily as the story progress show that she more aware than they be lead to believe and Hyeon give Tae joo a special birthday gift vampirism in do so Hyeon have create a monster Tae joo admits though a slip of the tonguethat in fact Kang woo never hurt she and as she thirst for blood it be soon realize that kill for a supply do not bother she morally or psychologically Tae joo become such a hand full Hyeon have to take desperate measure if he be to stop such a menace to society himself includedbr br i will say that Thirst be one of the good horror film I have see regard 2009 it be a methodical approach Park take and we be lead down a dark road with Hyeon and Tae joo as they commit terrible deed with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union innocent people die because of Hyeon s love what once be lust shift into an obsessive love by the endfor Tae joo and it will cease to end if he do not make a painful choice we see inside their head their soul and it be not always pretty 2 hour with they can be quite exhausting but credit to the director for pull no punch in regard to devious behavior and how the power of vampirism can be give to the wrong people Hyeon see as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accept hell for Tae joo so one could look at Thirst as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy onebr br In regard to the violence while Park do have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic detail there be enough sadism involve to perhaps turn the stomach a bit at the very least the way the violence be carry out may be certain to leave a lasting impact the sexual situation between Hyeon and Tae joo can be pretty heated and erotic while also sordid and morally reprehensible the movie I think be still quite a complex examination of the length one will go to remain attached to an object of affectionlust,"[[8], [1, 4], [19, 7, 4], [5, 8, 17, 18, 19], [19, 14], [17, 4, 2, 14, 6, 13, 8, 25, 4], [19, 7,

50,there be this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monster and the violence should be keep off screen Park Chan Wook throw that concept completely out the window and show directly what he want and what he want to show be pretty much anything he can think of leave it to the actor and dialog to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective Park seem willing to do just about anything to get his point across whether it be long involved ensemble scene with the camera whiz around a mah jong table or entire week confine to a single shot between two other scene dialog from the scene before and after bleed over they Park do not keep to a specifically structured style but focus more on tell the entire story of a couple s relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self annihilation and use vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama it be that simple and that complex at the same timebr br you get to give he credit too many people be ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight with Twilight almost always be the less of the work but here the story be actually comparable but this one be more raw and honest none of this sparkly come in the window during the night to talk crap but anything range from the dirty most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two lead begin to vie for power over one another it be the same deal guy and girl meet girl find out guy be a vampire decide to join he anyway but with no happily ever after just straight up limited time as they become force to keep each other close and close and run out of option the girl s motivation be particularly interesting as one desperately crave power and attention to a fault foil by the guy who just want to live a good life as well he can under the circumstance but be a hypocrite who can not admit that he be merely use his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral trainingbr br The movie be not perfect and it do tend to stretch there be no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance but what be great about it be that Park Chan Wook be willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delight the horror sensibility of tension and gore he also provide an expertly choose soundtrack to hit the emotional high note in a pretty effective way toobr br PolarisDiB,"[[19, 7, 4, 17, 4], [1, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [22, 7, 14, 11, 4], [19, 7, 4, 14, 17, 24], [14, 5], [7, 14, 17, 17, 14, 17], [19, 7, 0, 19], [18, 14, 12, 4],

53,Oldboy director Park Chun wook return with what must be one of the yucki and at the same time most serious vampire flick in movie historybr br Trusting the late Hollywood fad vampire these day be suppose to be rather nonviolent asexual love lorn chevalier instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood suck mind manipulate man beast of yore this be the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrill of the past well at least in the second halfbr br Thirst start out with a lengthy character exposition culminate in a slightly different love story the vampire transformation of a priest be over quite some time sideline by the romantic and sexual aspect of the story which make for some awkward viewing but the last 40 minute or so be surprisingly gory well maybe not so surprisingly if you know Oldboy and I be a Cyborg but that be ok but I guess it be fair to say that Thirst beat Park s early film in term of in your face violence br br All in all be warn that this be neither art cinema nor a horror flick it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some Thirst be original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun wook s early

54,Chan wook Park you have to hand it to the guy in my eye he be not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provide something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfyingbr br thirst be essentially a vampire tale but one that play fast and loose with some of the rule of the subgenre Kang ho Song play Father Sang hyeon a man who unselfishly give himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catch the disease they be try to cure die and come back all thank to the blood he be transfuse with be the only one out of five hundred to survive he become quite the celebrity to those who know he and all he want be to get back to normal normal however now involve be able to leap great distance without injury want to drink blood and get severely hot under the collar when ray of sun get on his skin it be not long before he be live with a rather dysfunctional family unit who know he in his childhood and while he hide his new strange lifestyle he find himself draw into a complex love triangle become more acceptable of dark thought and slide down a slippery slope that could lead he from man to beast to monsterbr br deftly blend a number of genre Park s movie feel much fresher and more original to I than let the right one in to use a recent example and genuinely impress I with it be approach to material that could easily have feel as well wear and rehash as any number of other vampire movie we have see over the year it be a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also ponder idea such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of immortality etc etcbr br Some people have complain that this genre blend approach weaken the movie but I personally find that it be a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie help by a great central performance from Song as the torture priest and fantastic turn from a support cast with no weak link many character get to move through a range of emotion and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman play by OK vin Kim who become the object of the priest s love lust and affectionbr br Fans of asian cinema and Park in particular and also fan of Poe s the Tell tale heart watch and learn should lap this up it be yet another classy movie from a man who seem to take everything in his stride and always manage to

55,I attend an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher both have deliver less than memorable performance film while the underlying general storyline be somewhat familiar this film be excellent both Costner and Kutcher deliver powerful performance play extremely well off each other the human frailty and strength of their respective character be incredibly play by both the scene when Costner confront Kutcher with the personal reason why Kutcher join the Coast Guard rescue elite be the film s most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline be an education in itself depict the personal sacrifice and demand physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuer must go through in preparation of their only job responsibility to save life at sea the special effect of the rescue scene be extremely realistic and wowing I have not see such angry sea since the Perfect Storm co star Clancy Brown HBO s Carnivale great to see he again play the captain of the Coast Guard s Kodiak Alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his vein the film wonderfully and finally give long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard it have the audience applaud at the end,"[[8], [0, 19, 19, 4, 13, 3], [0, 13], [0, 3, 21, 0, 13, 2, 4], [18, 2, 17, 4, 4, 13, 8,

56,the great thing about Thirst Chanwook Park s late film be that it be the anti twilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality it be a big plus Park take the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between Sang hyeon and Tae Joo we see the conflict of both of the characters Sang hyeon be a priest who undergo a medical experiment that unbeknownst to he turn he into a sickly but true blue vampire and Tae Joo with her mother and idiot brother the latter be kill by sang as in a very strong melodrama there be nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and character at any point and the implication put forth from religion early on Sang for example be see as a healer of sort since he rise from the dead thank to his vampirism even as he just can not be that and know it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematicallybr br That Thirst also rise up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park have display with Oldboy Lady Vengeance and the underrated I be a Cyborg but that be ok should be take as a give thirst be a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban character and be shoot and edit with an eye for a mood that be part satiric part romantic erotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical and it do not always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set up though as a horror movie Park have more than his share of scary scene it be more akin to the movie near Dark which never mention the word vampire but let you know it be and treat it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a person s existence be perhaps scary than the killing or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wound you have see em allbr br thirst also have a wicked sense of humor much like Oldboy only here with a bite pun intend mean to emphasize bizarre physical state of be an example of this can be find with the Priest s predilection of suck off of blood from people in coma by take their blood tube and suckle on it on the floor or the manner in which Tae Joo hold on to one scrap of humanity by keep her mother alive even as she be have something like a stroke and can only blink her eye and tap one finger as a means of react to the blood sucker who have bring pain and horror to her home but these moment be like ice on the cake to make it a complete experience what make Thirst last in the mind be how element come together of drama and existential pain of a bunuelian surreal sense of Catholicism I especially love the dynamic between Sang hyeon and the other priest who give his arm up for blood sucking but really want to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scene where the priest finally give in to Tae Joo be incredible in their pace and length of shot and how real it get not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these character release and escape which do not last long over the scope of the storybr br if it be not as great as Oldboy it be not something to carp about not all film Chanwook Park direct will reach the stature of his masterpiece and at the least he will always be know as the man who direct that movie but Thrist be an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movie in general the film making be crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of daylight the character live in the humor be dark and hilarious the acting be intense and moody especially from subtle stroke from Song Kang ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK vin and the ending when it do finally get there be one of those truly superb vampire movie ending you will be talk about for year in a good way in a battle between Thirst and Twilight Thirst take the knock out in the first round between let the right one in or Near Dark it be tough to call 9510,"[[19, 7, 4], [6, 17, 4, 0, 19], [19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [0, 1, 14, 20, 19], [19, 7,

59,now that I have see it it be not what I be expect at least not until the very END I read some of the other review before pick up a used copy of this from Amazon and be glad I do having be first introduce to Park s work via Oldboy I be curious to how he would treat the genre and be rather pleased at the clever manner in which he execute it I think Park have mature in term of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work have very nice and deliberate camera work he have some nice innovation in Bakjwi that I have not see in other vamp movie for example the scene where Father Hyeon be realize the beast grow within he as he give his shoe to the always barefoot Tae ju and he be able to see the blood pump through Tae ju s skin and his eye s widen in blood lust for it that be a nice effect I be also happy that Park do not cg the crap out of the movie and the be in fact very little cg at all I come away from Bakjwi be totally set up to think one thing be go to happen and get take for a ride in true Park fashion additionally I like that Park play with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we do not usually get this be Asia cinema during the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the character and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that be transpire park treat you a little like ghost of Christmas future come to show you albeit a bit boringly what life be like outside your world ah but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeon lust for Tae ju and conflict with duty as a priest we almost start to root for they even until Park not so nicely slap we back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi be a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong it will not spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think you will come away from it with what Park want you to come away with do not expect Oldboy and stylization because that be not what you will get here a very interesting take on the genre indeed those who miss the many literary element and religious allusion watch some other movie not Bakjwi after Bakjwi watch let the right one in it be also not what you will expect either,"[[13, 14, 22], [19, 7, 0, 19], [8], [7, 0, 21, 4], [18, 4, 4], [8, 19], [8, 19], [1, 4], [13, 14, 19], [22, 7, 0, 19], [8], [1,

61,the vampire craze have in my opinion actually prove its worthiness of such infamous categorization there be many sub genre film last year from a multitude of country I have review many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since I have recognize the trend as a phenomenon which it be and coincidentally feature my favorite horror staple I be go to now move outside of North America for a bit and introduce you to hopefully mean film that you do not see as of nowbr br Of the many effect of Twilight be the creation of guy and girl vampire movie I hate this sexist categorization which have the effect of polarize an entire generation of fan into side I think man be prone to hate Stephenie Meyer s work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which be always theirs be now liberate woman may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pic since they grow up with ironclad expectation that be enforce four time we need more director to create vampire film which either gender be capable of enjoy unequally if vampire be go to survive the craze and remain relevant Cue Thirst this korean film be direct by Park Chan Wook of Oldboy fame there be two way to dissect it either it straddle between gender expectation and be universally marginally enjoyable or it be a flounder mess that do not decide which target audience it prefer and should therefore be view by no one do not let I convince you that the film have no inclination its director be a man whose fame be story drive action film its protagonist be male and have a passive aggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he have know both before and after mortal life be not contrive and his attention be return there be a male slant to this picture yet it be not so one side that woman could not enjoy it the same can not be say of Daybreakers or New Moonbr br The plot follow an Emile Zola novel call Thrse Raquin which I have not read accord to Wikipedia the novel be about an affair that develop between a married woman and a single man he kill her husband during a fishing trip and begin date she the two of they be

but fall for Shin s young wife OK vin Kim Kim be intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lover the film from there go in weird direction that I think one should experience for themselves what really should be mention be Chan wook Park s mastery of the medium of cinema my God I have rarely see such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his power the major flaw of the film be that it be a little incoherent especially near the beginning Park be interested in tell his story mostly in the visual which can be difficult to follow at time but when it work man do it fly the film be also perversely hilarious the final sequence easily one of the good of the decade be simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous ok vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film she give one of the good performance of the year,"[[5, 17, 14, 12], [19, 7, 4], [3, 8, 17, 4, 2, 19, 14, 17], [14, 5], [14, 11, 3, 1, 14, 24], [2, 14, 12, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [18, 11,

it all fall into place make complete sense and it be then that you know you be not simply watch another silly 80 s slasher with a pea brain plot thank god for that seriously though Bloody Birthday be base on a ridiculous premise but it more than make up for that with it be originality have a bunch of kid go round slaughter people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever see in cinema but when give the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone I know what I would choosebr br also help the film out of the hole that some people would think it be silly plot dig it into be the fact that it be extremely entertaining many slasher become formulaic far too quickly and the audience end up watch simply to see some gore this film however keep itself go with some great creepy performance from the kid which hark back to creepy kid classic such as Village of the Damned a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that I like a lot about this movie be the vast array of weaponry there be nothing bad than a slasher where the killer use the same weapon over and over again cough Halloween cough but that be not the case here as Bloody Birthday find room for everything from skip rope to bow and arrow there be not any room for a chainsaw which be a huge shame but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it,"[[8], [10, 13, 14, 22], [11, 8, 19, 19, 11, 4], [14, 17], [13, 14, 19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [0, 1, 14, 20, 19], [0, 18, 19, 17, 14, 13, 14, 12, 24], [1, 20, 19], [13, 4, 21, 4, 17, 19,

78,sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase I do not know what I be think but I really could not help myselfbr br Ive be mean to see bloody Birthday for a long time and I must say that it be a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price and believe I I live in a small south american village and these thing be very unlikely to happen it be a real shame that some of these gem from the 80 be now almost completely forget Bloody Birthday be one of those movie that surprisingly age well enough to remain watchable nowadays not a masterpiece for sure but still entertain and guess what it do not really have unintentionally funny scene I know it be a shocker if we keep in mind that this be a low budget flick from the early 80 about a group of evil child who kill people but trust I the movie manage to remain respectable and watchable for the most partbr br In blood Birthday the story revolve around three child who be bear during a a total eclipse accord to astrology during eclipse the sun and the moon block Saturn which control emotion as a consequence the three child who be bear that day eventually become uncaring and evil since they do not experience any feeling of remorse whatsoever these 10 year old kid gang up against basically everyone who stand in their way include their own parent and sibling and kill they the body count increase day after day and the police authority believe that there be a psychopath lurk around the place in the meantime Debbie Curtis and Steven do not hesitate to keep butcher people since nobody seem to suspect of those sweet angel face br br like I be say before Bloody birthday be surprisingly not funny I know I say that before but I be truly surprised by this I be expect some hilariously bad scene but the movie prove I wrong true it be not exactly what most people would consider a serious horror movie but if I have to be fair I would say that the story be decently execute one of the most important reason why one would normally expect laughable situation like I do it be because in these kind of movie in which the main villain be child the young actor tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable let us face it kid tend to be horrible actor which be understandable and we can not blame they for that but to my surprise the three young actor who play the merciless killer in this film look very disturbing and not at all funny the rest of the actor be also good and if you be a George Clooney fan you can see his uncle play a doctor in this movie yeah I know right who care also Julie Brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon give a solid performance as the naughty old sister and in case anyone be interested in nudity she also strip in one of the scene and she look great naked too bad she do not have more time on the screen though Julie be absolutely fabulousp br br So basically this movie be fine if you be in the mood for some modest horror from the 80 my only objection regard Bloody birthday would be the way to justify the child s motive this be perhaps one of the low point of the film let us see if child who be bear during an eclipse end up be heartless killer then how come these three be the only one who actually murder people I be sure there be other child who have be bear the same day and during other day of total eclipse too oh well overall no big deal it be just a simple observation that be all I have see bad trust I take the Children 1980 for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after be turn into zombie by toxic cloud no believe I Bloody birthday be far more decent and if you enjoy simple slasher you be go to enjoy this one very muchbr br so now you know you be invite to the child s birthday party and the host will be serve a delicious poison cake for you and the rest of the guest come on you can not miss it,"[[18, 14, 17, 17, 24], [0, 1, 14, 20, 19], [19, 7, 4], [4, 23, 19, 17, 4, 12, 4,

82,I can not believe I rarely ever see this title mention by all you eighty horror freak and I definitely will not be join all my fellow reviewer here in say that bloody birthday be awful viewing on the contrary I enjoy it very much and I be pleasantly surprise by the ingeniousness and surprise twist it offer do not just refer to this film as be another 80 s slasher because the victim here be rather unlikely and so be the killer we be introduce to three cherubic look youngster who be all bear during a solar eclipse at the moment they be deliver planet Saturn be block by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kid be emotionless and seemly without conscience this really start to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spreebr br grante this stuff be incredibility far fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who care unlike many other horror film from this period it at least attempt to bring something original and imaginative for once the kid acting be good and the entire film have a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murder sequence be grim and tense and it be always eerie to see they getting commit by angel face kid I do not know who hire the 3 kid but they do a good job especially the girl and the kid with glass be highly memorable the bleak image of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlight such as village of

83,interesting cartoon include on the dvd of the lost Skeleton of Cadavra I especially like the way the color be use in the background art very artistic for Columbia whose cartoon department generally have a very low budget and the result look like itbr br i do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever get past the censor grant the gesture in question be see a lot less frequently in 1937 than it be today you would think someone besides the animator would have notice though especially since it be see three time in the scene in question and base on the context I suspect that its inclusion be intentional something the animator slip in just to see if the censor would notice,"[[8, 13, 19, 4, 17, 4, 18, 19, 8, 13, 6], [2, 0, 17, 19, 14, 14, 13], [8, 13, 2, 11, 20, 3, 4], [14, 13], [19, 7, 4], [3, 21, 3], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [11, 14, 18, 19], [18, 10, 4, 11, 4, 19, 14, 13], [14, 5], [2, 0, 3, 0, 21, 17, 0], [8], [4, 18, 15, 4, 2, 8, 0, 11, 11, 24], [11, 8, 10, 4], [19, 7, 4], [22, 0, 24], [19, 7, 4], [2, 14, 11, 14, 17], [1, 4], [20, 18, 4], [8, 13], [19, 7, 4], [1, 0, 2, 10, 6, 17, 14, 20, 13, 3], [0, 17, 19], [21, 4, 17, 24], [0, 17, 19, 8, 18, 19, 8, 2], [5, 14, 17], [2, 14, 11, 20, 12, 1, 8, 0], [22, 7, 14, 18, 4], [2, 0, 17, 19, 14, 14, 13], [3, 4, 15, 0, 17, 19, 12, 4, 13, 19], [6, 4, 13, 4, 17, 0, 11, 11, 24], [7, 0, 21, 4], [0], [21, 4, 17, 24], [11, 14, 22], [1, 20, 3, 6, 4, 19], [0, 13, 3], [19, 7, 4], [17, 4, 18, 20, 11, 19], [11, 14, 14, 10], [11, 8, 10, 4], [8, 19, 1, 17], [1, 17], [8], [3, 14], [22, 14, 13, 3, 4, 17], [7, 14, 22, 4, 21, 4, 17], [7, 14, 22], [0], [2, 4, 17, 19, 0, 8, 13], [20, 12], [5, 8, 13, 6, 4, 17], [6, 4, 18, 19, 20, 17, 4], [4, 21, 4, 17], [6, 4, 19], [15, 0, 18, 19], [19, 7, 4], [2, 4, 13, 18, 14, 17], [6, 17, 0, 13, 19], [19, 7, 4], [6, 4, 18, 19, 20, 17, 4], [8, 13], [16, 20, 4, 18, 19, 8, 14, 13], [1, 4], [18, 4, 4], [0], [11, 14, 19], [11, 4, 18, 18], [5, 17, 4, 16, 20, 4, 13, 19, 11, 24], [8, 13], [27, 35, 29, 33], [19, 7, 0, 13], [8, 19], [1, 4], [19, 14, 3, 0, 24], [24, 14, 20], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [19, 7, 8, 13, 10], [18, 14, 12, 4, 14, 13, 4], [1, 4, 18, 8, 3, 4, 18], [19, 7, 4], [0, 13, 8, 12, 0, 19, 14, 17], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [7, 0, 21, 4], [13, 14, 19, 8, 2, 4], [19, 7, 14, 20, 6, 7], [4, 18, 15, 4, 2, 8, 0, 11, 11, 24], [18, 8, 13, 2, 4], [8, 19], [1, 4], [18, 4, 4], [19, 7, 17, 4, 4], [19, 8, 12, 4], [8, 13], [19, 7, 4], [18, 2, 4, 13, 4], [8, 13], [16, 20, 4, 18, 19, 8, 14, 13], [0, 13, 3], [1, 0, 18, 4], [14, 13], [19, 7, 4], [2, 14, 13, 19, 4, 23, 19], [8], [18, 20, 18, 15, 4, 2, 19], [19, 7, 0, 19], [8, 19, 18], [8, 13, 2, 11, 20, 18, 8, 14, 13], [1, 4], [8, 13, 19, 4, 13, 19, 8, 14, 13, 0, 11], [18, 14, 12, 4, 19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [19, 7, 4], [0, 13, 8, 12, 0, 19, 14, 17], [18, 11, 8, 15], [8, 13], [9, 20, 18, 19], [19, 14], [18, 4, 4], [8, 5], [19, 7, 4], [2, 4, 13, 18, 14, 17], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [13, 14, 19, 8, 2, 4]]"

85,in 1929 director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks change the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their Silly Symphonies series the Skeleton Dance iwerk and Disney have be collaborate together since the early 20 in Disney s Laugh o Gram cartoon series however their friendship suffer a tremendous blow when Iwerks accept an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio that be the birth of Celebrity Productions where iwerk continue develop his style and technique and where he create the character of Flip the frog while his work keep the same high quality it be not really popular and by 1936 the studio be close later that year Iwerks be hire by Columbia Pictures and Iwerks decide to return to his old skeleton for another dance this time in colorbr br 1937 s Skeleton Frolics be essentially a remake of the 1929 classic the Skeleton Dance the movie that borough he fame and fortune like that short film it be set on an abandon graveyard where at midnight the creature of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffin ready for the show that be about to begin as a group of skeleton have form an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it be not easy to be a musician make of just bone as some of the orchestra member have problem with their body part however the band manage to put a good show and another group of skeleton begin to dance a lovely couple of they face the same problem that trouble the orchestra it be hard to dance with loose body part everything end at dawn and just when the sun be about to rise again the skeleton run towards their gravesbr br directe and animate by Ub Iwerks himself Skeleton Frolics follow faithfully the pattern set by the Skeleton Dance year before although with a crucial difference iwerk do the whole film in Technicolor the bright tonality allow Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new technique he have be practice since leave Disney create even well effect of depth and dynamism than those he conceive before it be certainly a more experimental film than the Skeleton Dance although sadly this do not mean it be necessarily a well film for starter the film be practically identical to the one he do with Disney with the only difference be the music more on that later and the color effect it look beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feel kind of unoriginal after allbr br However it be not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurt the film after all Iwerks execute it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody create by Joe DeNat for the film be pretty uninteresting and lack the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one do by Carl W Stalling for the Skeleton Dance in other word while DeNat s tune be effective and appropriate for the theme it be easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling s song have a unique personality that make it unforgettable be a musical film this be of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music bring down Iwerk s flawless work of animation personally I think that with a well musical accompaniment Skeleton Frolics would be remember as fondly as the Skeleton Dance despite not be as groundbreaking as it be still a fun film to watchbr br it s kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks do after leave Disney be now forget due to his poor success however it must be say that if iwerk lack the popularity of Disney or Fleischer Disney s main rival he do not lack the quality of those company film it be probably just a case of bad luck what make the man who give life to Disney s mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney despite its shortcoming Skeleton Frolics be a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can not help but thinking of the Skeleton Dance while watch it it definitely remind we that Iwerk s skeleton be still here to haunt we and inspire usbr br 810,"[[8, 13], [27, 35, 28, 35], [3, 8, 17, 4, 2, 19, 14, 17], [22, 0, 11, 19], [3, 8, 18, 13, 4, 24], [0, 13, 3], [0, 13, 8, 12, 0, 19, 14, 17], [20, 1], [8, 22, 4, 17,

101,Director Mikhail Kalatozov s film the Cranes be fly Letyat zhuravli be a glorious piece of cinema from the screenplay by Viktor Rozov base on his own play Kalatozov show we a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those leave at home inundate with countless war movie show we the frontline and the carnage the topic itself become tedious and avoidable however this russian gem show how the tale of hardship can be tell in a different way by tell we straight from a soldier s mouth how war be hate by all that they hope those who die do so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of WWII we have young man volunteer to wage war for peace to keep their family and love one safe at home rather than draftee fight a battle they do not believe in with so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people be die for no reason against their will it be nice to see a film that show just how selfless and heroic these soldier be as well as those await their returnbr br Communist Russia show how involve all be in the war while Boris may have volunteer to go to the frontline his father be head doctor of a hospital aid in the mending of soldier injure and his sister be help he there as well as his girl Veronika do all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter have arrive from her love an entire city come out to send the boy off in celebration even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representative over with gift of gratitude whether this be all a glorify look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not I do not know there be no protest or badmouthing of these boy risk their life for a country it be all praise and thank some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protest and wreak havoc in its name only sully what these man and woman be sacrifice each and everydaybr br The acting be top notch throughout but some deserve single out I really enjoy Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris grandmother she be the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving be very evident on her face and through her body language Vasili Merkuryev as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich bring what be perhaps the good performance as speak at the end about father need to choke back hidden tear Merkuryev epitomize those sentiment he put on a tough exterior especially crack joke and ride his son hard when he find out about his volunteering just hour before he must leave but when Boris exit to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seat in sorrow at the table he love his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to he his action throughout the film express it to the audience Aleksey Batalov be effective as Boris a happy go lucky young man and idealist do what he believe be right and Aleksandr Shvorin be good as the villainous Mark stay home due to his talented piano skill or maybe just to steal his cousin s love that love play by Tatyana Samojlova really draw the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope the true star of the film she must go through many emotion on a journey where she do lose her way need to steer back on course hope that she do so soon enough for Boris returnbr br Besides the realism to the story as well as be unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across I also love the visual style of the film Sergei Urusevsky s cinematography be amazing especially when consider the movie be shoot in fullscreen it be one thing to create stunning composition in a widescreen panorama it be completely different to do so in a square frame right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lover skip their way up the screen and into the distance there be multiple instance of the camera be behind barrier yet still allow for the action to be see create unique spatial depth and interest at all time sharp angle be utilize as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shot and exaggerated juxtaposition of character in frame togetherbr br the real feat however be those instance of the long shot use well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of return soldier it be magnificent early on as she roam through those say goodbye to their love one while she search for Boris her own farewell need to be say the planning for this shot must have be extensive because while she weave in and out of people the camera focus on couple kiss people yell to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moment while the camera move through everyone need to hit his mark precisely and it lead to a brilliant piece of cinema it be just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style the crane be fly show how successful placement and mise en scne can be in show the audience what it need in as simple a way as possible composition and professionalism from the actor and crew can work wonder add something that huge setpiece and special effect can never do,"[[3, 8, 17, 4, 2, 19, 14, 17], [12, 8, 10, 7,

104,it be not difficult after watch this film to see why post silent soviet cinema be hold in such little critical esteem do not get I wrong the CRANES be fly be for the first half at least supremely entertaining boast a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin a fresh brisk spacious technique that eventually irritate as much as it initially charm two stunning subjective set piece and a romantic verve that flirt with but never quite topple into lelouch territory it be just that in its subsuming of vast social national and world event to a love affair it be essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood moviebr br Of course in a Soviet Union that emphasise the state above all else and in an era World War Two that suppress individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism this foregrounding of two appeal young lover be a relief and the thematic similarity all consume love rent apart by war with two of the most wonderful of all film SEVENTH HEAVEN LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG also add to its potential loveabilitybr br The story be simple enough Boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and Veronika a student conduct a breezy relationship at night their only free time Boris s cousin Mark a composer also have eye on Veronika when the Nazis invade Russia Boris secretly volunteer to the chagrin of his family and lover he promise to write to Veronika but never do think maybe she have not bother to see he off or perhaps the mail be simply unreliable Veronika s parent die during an air raid and she move in with Boris s family help out at the hospital where his father tend wound soldiersbr br distresse by Boris s silence Veronika be also assail by the attention of Mark who have gain exemption from military duty by bribe a local official she be eventually wear down and marry he to the disapproval of her adopt family Boris meanwhile be kill in action Veronika disgust with herself and an adulterous Mark refuse to believe this and await his return foster a young orphan bear his namebr br The title refer to the bird the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its transcendant epiphanical power but this be illusory the crane fly in a v formation and this shape pervade the entire film through the geometric shape of building interior exterior grouping of people composition camera angle the heroine s name or by edit in which foot walk southwest in one story be meet by foot walk southeast in another br br this serve to fatally trap the lover who have no control over their destiny and also suggest the stalinist power that be never specifically mention in the film although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an unpeopled environment or privilege in generous close up they be always ironise minimised tear apart by circumstance family by crowd see the brilliant if obvious sequence where Veronika be engulf by tank or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd or simply by the film s structure which be constantly distancing through paralellism their closeness although at the beginning the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll it be constantly be break by strange edit or camera angle of distract snatch of musicbr br What be most remarkable be how these block to romance be achieve by abstract rather than emphasise historical force the whole film but especially the war itself be strangely unreal and dreamlike we be never show its harsh brutal actuality just its effect on the lover in fact it be transform into a majestic spectacle devoid of nasty Germans br br On the home front the air raid create delicious effect of light and shade or ruin of almost gothic decadence in the bunker the threat to the soviet empire be less important than Boris s perceive indifference the empty oneiric Moscow space the lover initially than Veronika with her mother walk though be less actual location than emotional space br br When Mark try to force himself on Veronika the air raid be less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustration this be a brilliant sequence film with silent expressionistic terror in which the screen seem to burst with hysteria and violence all the more compelling for the early scene wistful gentlenessbr br It be not much different at the front either where fight over girl honour be more urgent than tactic nazi or despair the movement of Boris and his wound comrade into a final space be a further abstracting of the experience of war its setting in a forest give it a sexual dynamic and Boris final pre death flashback be an extraordinary mixture of dream wish fulfillment and heighten anxiety in which what be wish for become menacing and grotesquebr br From this point on the film become a little less interesting slightly more obvious one more grasp for Expressionist overload Veronika s attempt suicide and she rescue the infant be clumsily handle and her sombre guilt cast a paralyse shadow over the whole film the use of deep focus at first ravishing soon become wear devoid as it be of any of the moral force or mean Welles bring to its use in CITIZEN KANE after what seem a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual be cruelly betray at the end when individual suffering as so often in russian art transmute into symbolic ie sexless dehumanised hope a pity,"[[8, 19], [1, 4], [13, 14, 19], [3, 8, 5, 5, 8, 2, 20, 11, 19], [0, 5, 19, 4, 17], [22, 0, 19, 2, 7], [19, 7, 8, 18], [5, 8, 11, 12], [19,

105,unlike the many who have post here I be not movie literate I stumble across this movie by accident channel surfing and could not surf away this be a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critic and those on this site have heap on it the actor be terrific Tatiana be beautiful and innocent her fianc Boris be sweet and patriotic you could not help but feel Boris father s exasperation and sorrow as he upbraid his son for such foolishness as volunteer to serve in the great warbr br other have summarize the movie so well so I will just mention a couple of scene that move I the most when Boris brother reveal to his family that he have break trust with his brother and have to marry Tatiana Tatiana s twisted mouth show her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have be through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visit just destruction on Tatiana and the brother or bad show Tatiana destroy by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence since this be not french existential cinema the latter do not happen thankfully br br Another scene that tear at your heart be when the unnamed musician soldier who be save by Boris return to tell Boris father of the death of his son he unwittingly break the news to Tatiana I can not describe the sorrow of this scene still Tatiana find find a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home the musician actually never see Boris bury after allbr br i will not mention more scene but do want to observe that the touch of soviet political correctness do not detract at all from the film Boris brother be reveal as the piano play anti soviet slacker that someone who steal his brother s wife to be would have to be no doubt he get at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when Tatiana finally learn for certain that Boris be dead still manage to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you do not even want to imagine the tear and catharsis that must have sweep through the theater when survivor of that war with their own loss in mind first see this moviebr br incredible go see it,"[[20, 13, 11, 8, 10, 4],

outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteer but from which he will never return the girl a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova be also love by the young man s cousin and when she do not receive word from her boyfriend give in to the latter and marry he he however be an aspire concert pianist bitter about the war having curtail his chance for success and know too that the girl s still devoted to the soldier begin to neglect she finally word reach the girl of her love one s death but by the end of the film she have learn to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and be content to live with her memory of himbr br The film feature some truly amazing camera work which make extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopt tracking tilted and high or low angle shot render great power to the unfold emotional drama individual sequence be equally impressive two in particular the stunning scene frenetically edit and speed up to boot in which the girl save an abandon boy from be trample by a truck and the young man s premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the good of its kind I have ever watch with the sun move away from he symbolize the life that be seep out of his body as he imagine the wedding day he will never have also notable however be the scene where the girl go to look for her parent in her home that be be hopelessly devastate during an air raid as be her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist which she try to resist by repeatedly slap he in the face take place during a later air

117,I would like to tell you just a few thing before consider see this movie if at one point or another you think you have see good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie for the record this movie be make in 1957 in Russia but the technique use here be probably something that we have see much later in the western world about 20 year later the level of emotion through the film vary quite a lot happiness love war despair joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of see one masterpiece of filmmaking the young director from our time should study more this kind of movie and maybe they will be able to create something similar even though I think movie like this be very hard to come by if you have see I be Cuba then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepare for a unique experience the russian director have something in common very small budget great actor and a joy of create art and yes they be able to create more masterpiece than all the western world together I be not a big fan of Russia actually I hate everything that be communist but the film make in that part of the world manage to create such feeling that be hard to describebr br Enjoy itbr br,"[[8], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [11, 8, 10, 4], [19, 14], [19, 4, 11, 11], [24, 14, 20], [9, 20, 18, 19], [0], [5, 4, 22], [19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [1, 4, 5, 14, 17, 4], [2, 14, 13,

124,have long disdain network television programming I remember the first time I catch an episode of Police Squad it be totally by accident it be during the show s initial network run on ABC in early 1982 I be a chronic channel surfer and be flip the dial one evening when suddenly appear Police Squad be open credit sequence on my tv screen I immediately recognize it as a sendup of the opening credit of M Squad star Lee Marvin one of my all time favorite cop show I stop surf then of course come headquarters getting shoot up follow by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln by now I be say to myself what the heck be this then come special guest star Georg Stanford Brown getting flatten by a plummet safe I be hook from that moment the episode be Ring of Fear a Dangerous Assignment with its comic reference to on the waterfront and Muhammed Ali but most memorable of course be all the sight gag and non sequitur Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of M Squad be an absolute riot finally I say to myself a network television program truly worth watch would not you know it would be cancel just a few week later leave it to the network I should have know anyway I just buy the dvd collection of all six episode and they be just as funny today as they be 27 year ago the Naked Gun movie be terrific as well but I really miss Alan North he be so good as Ed Hocken Peter Lupus as Nordberg what be they think cast OJ in that part and especially William Duell s Johnny the shoeshine guy great stuff,"[[7, 0, 21, 4], [11, 14, 13, 6], [3, 8, 18,

125,nothing like this be see on tv at that time and probably never will again from the first image of that police light blind you and from there you hear the word Police Squad in color you be schocke to see that this in no way be an ordinary sitcombr br also to kill off a Guest Star and then never refer to he again where have you ever see that before then the actual show start and if you do not pay attention you would miss several joke in the background do not pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry this be the show that video recorder be make for way before marry with Children or the Simpsonsbr br The story do in no way make sense and the dialog be sometimes so weird that you have to think about it for 5 minute before realise that it be a jokebr br The character Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken come right out of Dragnet and they be absolutely straight no funny accent or expression but instead there be pun and twisted sentence play absolutely deadpan only once as I can remember be there a segment play for silly laugh a scene involve a trip to a dentist suction and a whole lot of salivabr br There be some tedious moment like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity that be strictly a one joke moment but they have to use it in all six episode oh well everything can not be perfect the important thing be that the rest of the time you be knee deep in tear of laughterbr br Leslie Nielsen be fortunate that this revive his career when they put the Frank Drebin character in 3 feature but it must have be an Achilles heel as well can you remember see he in anything except Naked Gun type work since and do not count the awful Mr Magoo rework for live action he probably make a lot of money though,"[[13, 14, 19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [11, 8, 10, 4], [19, 7,

127,I remember watch Police Squad when it first come on ABC in 1982 and I think it be a very funny show thank to the many sight gag non sequitor and script fill with word play in one episode there be a line where a man name once be shoot twice br br But unfortunately ABC cancel the show after only six episode I feel it deserve a much long run but a network executive think the show demand too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gag in each episode one that I remember be in the opening where the episode s title be different from the one show on the screen br br Leslie Nielsen s portrayal of Frank Drebin be deadpan yet very funny and his role be in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet Alan North do well and Peter Lupus in one of his few role since mission Impossible be

and the original MST3k complete with bearded hostbr br Capt Frank Drebin play by the stone face dead pan filibuster Leslie Nielson be a process create first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonist think Dragnet meet Starsky Hutch the Show boil in a flask full of well know police television show plot and scenario this be distil 3 time to produce the most pure policeman every make forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz for now save it for later Frank Drebin be clueless at most time a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable he be a master of the police investigative methodology aka ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe Shine Boy this do not make he a bad cop cop get lucky also Capt Drebin notice he be a Captain here have perfect it along with his partner Nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodesbr br The show be a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote able Most of the sight gag be a bit date and silly the magic never come from the sight gag however at its core be a nonsensical and straight face conversation and activity in the foreground with crazy thing occur in the background the movie can well be describe as 90 minute compilation of the good gag from this series think of Monty Python s and now for something completely different br br if you like Airplane 1 2 Naked Gun 123 or Top Secret then you will definitely enjoy this br br I always like the series well than the movie even though I see the movie first why 2 word

132,the creative team of Jim Abrahams David Zucker and Jerry Zucker have their root in improvisational theatre in Madison Wisconsin I believe it be they have a group call Kentucky Fried Theatreor something similar they put a bunch of their set piece onto celluloid askentucky FRIED MOVIE1977 which be long irreverent sophomoric and really funnybr br They follow up with the very popular AIRPLANE 1980 which really put they on the map in it they take some rather well know veteran actor in Robert Stack and especially Leslie Nielsen and put they in prominent role proceed to parody every clich of every aviation film since the day of John Wayne s batjacproduction of the HIGH and the MIGHTY 1954 pocket stuff with cash and now having be notice the trio work out a deal with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless Police Crime Drama show that have come and go on our television screen over the year remember the fine job that Mr Leslie Nielsen have turn in on AIRPLANE he be cast in the leadbr br As Sgt LtCaptain Frank Drebbin the rank designation switch be one of their comic bitshe preside over a great series of successive pun sight gag non sequitor and overblown police crime clichs all of these string together by some seemingly standard script add to this be overly dramatic opening narration voice over information contradict the visual print info they always use this in give the title of the episode title where voice and print title never matchedbr br They have a great musical score which even though be somewhat exaggerated would have pass as theme and incidental music in a straight drama the musical score the opening title and format of have the episode divide into Act i Act II Epilogue etc be all part of obvious but affectionate rib of QM Quinn Martin Productions they even have the same announcer as do the real qmsbr br One thing that this all too short of a series do not have be a technically augment audience laughter and boy they sure do not need any phony tract the nature of the spoof be such that it demand the viewer s close almost undivided attention and that prove to be the ultimate reason behind POLICE SQUAD s downfallbr br In regard to the series cancellation an ABC Executive explain that the episode call for too much attention on the part of the viewer so be not that what one would wantbr br So after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episode off to the afterlife of series cancellation go POLICE SQUAD only to be reborn in the NAKED GUN trilogy make for the big screen in movie house once again they do quite well at the Box Office oh well tv s loss be Cinema s gain thank to you Mr Idiot TV Execbr br the high and MIGHTY be produce by the Duke s own Batjac

136,the funniest show ever on tv albeit the humor be not for everyone I realize it would have be hard to keep the show fresh if it have run long but it be a shame only six episode be film the gag fly rapidly from the opening credit until the very end when you would see Drebin and his boss Ed Hocken pretend to be in freeze frame as the closing credit roll during which the criminal still move would see everyone else motionless and try to escape in another episode the building start collapse around they as Drebin and Hocken remain in freeze modebr br Leslie Nielsen be comedic brilliance as Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show how he manage to keep a straight face through some of this be beyond I because the joke and sight gag come so often and quick you can watch the episode a 2nd and 3rd time and catch thing you miss the first time if you be like I you can watch they over and over and still find yourself laugh even the joke that make no sense nor seemingly have any reason to they such as the Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tag line in the opening announcement somehow work perhaps they be throw in there precisely for that reasonbr br cleverly spoof the old Quinn Martin detective cop show of the 1970 Police Squad would return from commercial break with the word Act Two appear on the screen which be immediately follow by Yankees one or some other quip on the opening credit the episode s title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title my favorite joke and line from this series be way too numerous to list but one of my favorite be when Drebin ask a down on his luck boxer who have previously tank fight do you think you can beat the Champ the boxer respond I can take he blindfold to which Drebin respond back but what if he be not blindfold a minute later in reference to the boxer s small dingy apartment Drebin tell he I be go to help you get out of this sewer the next thing you see Drebin be pop up through a manhole cover on the street in another episode Drebin and Hocken be question a bombing suspect s flimsy alibi Drebin not believe he say alright let us say you do go the movie after a slight pause Drebin Hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say you do go the movie a few moment later when Drebin be force to let the suspect bomber walk free due to lack of evidence he storm away and angrily yell tell that bomber to take off what be see next be a cop give the thumb up signal to a WWII style plane on a runway right outside the building while there be many classic Drebin quote one particularly memorable one be sorry to bother you Mrs Twice we would have come early but your husband be not dead then another classic be I be a locksmith and I be a locksmith when a visibly shake kidnap victim s father ask Drebin what I do I do Drebin in classic deadpan fashion respond back well as I understand it you be in the textile business as I say the humor be not for everyone many people simply will not get it during the show s brief run I remember the reaction be very mixed some people think it be absolutely hysterical and one of the funny thing around while other think it be the stupid and unfunny for I Police Squad even 20 year later be the funniest thing I have ever see on tv for young viewer who enjoy this type of humor but who have never see Police Squad because they be too young when the series initially air I highly recommend I find the six episode to be even funny than the subsequent Naked Gun movie,"[[19, 7, 4], [5, 20, 13, 13, 8, 4, 18, 19], [18, 7, 14, 22],

140,the creative team that bring we Police Squad and the Naked Gun derive from it say in interview that they be tell by their network contact that the show would be cancel after their delivery of the first episode basically the show be never give any chance typical Hollywood the contact apparently tell the team that the problem with the show be that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it most show be present on tv with the understanding that the viewer need to get up and miss a few minute while get food or go to the toilet etcbr br The humor of the show be extremely dry it use no laugh track and the universe the character inhabit be one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it be totally unbelievable so for instance in one episode a surgeon have to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgerybr br those familiar with the Naked Gun film should be warn that there be a number of interesting disjunction between the show and the film in the film Nielsen develop a particular take approach that be eye widen when confront with the unexpected this do not happen in the show where Nielsen s Drebin be the center around which the rest of the universe revolve nothing be unexpected to he also there be no romance in the show and no parody of MTV finally the show take certain risk that the film avoid in the first episode Drebin to re enact the crime have a squad of homicide detective shoot each other from a number of different angle ballistic the hard way this be actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that it be perfectly normal for policeman to kill each other while investigate a crime for no other reason than experimentation this sort of thing rarely happen in the filmsbr br Taken individually each of the episode be actually funny than any one of the Naked Gun film since they be both more compact more happen in a short time frame yet more leisurely pace there be not the rush for a punch line as sometimes happen in the film there be some inconsistency that happen in the film primarily 2 and 3 that never occur in the show s short time framebr br Of course there be no doubt that Naked Gun the first film be one of the great comedy of theatrical cinema and if you watch the tv show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away one s tolerancebr br none the less it would be useful to have a dvd of this and watch an episode a day for a few week if laughter have as some claim medicinal value watch this show be good for one s

144,what be worth mention that be omit in the other review I have read here be the subtext of how the law shape the life and behaviour of gay in the era portray in the film while Courtenay s character be evidently gay he be not the only one the often talk about Mr Davenport Scott be the other and the reason that he be never see the reason allude to that he have disappear seem to be that he have be detain by the police for homosexual activity a criminal offense in England at the timebr br We can read under the surface that this recent event have unsettle Norman Courtenay s character and we can also see in a pass remark by Oxenby the Edward Fox character the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law be involve the fear of association affect many of the character and be part of the portrait the film paint of a time and the people who inhabit it the abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir have be anticipate all the way through if this subtext be include it also make sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he give thank to the flamboyance combine with the fear of exposure produce the combination of yearn and fear that Courtenay have to step into the footlight as he do when he make the announcement about the imminent air raid a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that be both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man s inner tormentbr br So while the drama be of the decline of Finney s Sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play come from the fatal flaw of Courtenay s gayness and make this a film about he as the title suggestsbr br The art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighty and in some way even than the second world war the implicit portrait of a society still cling to an old moral order and the sympathy of the character rack and ruin by the cruelty of that order of necessity trap in the enclose world of the theatre and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be sweep away after the war make this film all the more poignant for all its flaw,"[[22, 7, 0, 19], [1, 4], [22, 14, 17, 19,

149,although I be not crazy about musical COVER GIRL be a delight for classic movie buff and especially for fan of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly the film may be date by today s standard and the story and song may be nothing special but the musical number be magnificently stage and there be a terrific cast to go with the film plus the film be a worthy introduction for fan of Rita Hayworth she be simply breathtake in glorious Technicolorbr br Despite Jerome Kern s collaboration with the film his music here be nowhere near as special or memorable as his song in swing TIME 1936 yet the song serve the film well the dancing be nothing short of excellent especially come from Gene Kelly s solo number and my favorite musical number Alter Ego Dance the amusing Phil Silvers nearly steal the film as Kelly s partner Otto Kruger Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good performance in their dramatic support role and Rita play a sweet charming girl here a role that be a far cry from her femme fatale babe in film like blood and sand 1941br br all in all this be a delightful film that be worth watch even if you be not big on musical yet the film s music could have be more memorable if only my favorite period songwriter Irving Berlin or Cole Porter write the song for this film however it be the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that be the real treat of the film s productionbr br while I be watch Rita Hayworth do her stuff I do not think I have ever see a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I see Moira Shearer in Michael Powell s masterpiece the RED SHOES 1948 just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with she,"[[0, 11, 19, 7, 14, 20, 6, 7], [8], [1, 4], [13, 14, 19], [2, 17, 0, 25, 24], [0, 1, 14, 20, 19], [12, 20, 18,

151,this be Gene Kelly s breakthrough and that alone make it memorable throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredient

and love interest be Rusty Parker Rita Hayworth Rita be lovely and even play a dual role as Rusty and Rusty s grandmother Rusty have a chance at the big time through the machination of John Coudair Otto Kruger who romance and lose Rusty s grandmotherbr br The plot revolve around Danny cut Rusty loose to the detriment of his club because she have a chance at success that he can not give she but

159,a fantastic musical star Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth he own a nightclub where she dance she be no star yet but she get a big break when she be choose as a cover girl for Vanity whose owner be actually in love with her grandmother when he see the resemblance he pick she right away for a contest his maganzine be run Hayworth s newfound fame at first work wonder for Kelly s club but her star rise so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begin to falter this be not the most original of plot but the two lead really make it work it also help that the screenplay be great Kelly be not yet at his peak especially his peak as an actor his dancing however wow Hayworth be the star but Kelly claim the film s most memorable moment as he dance passionately with his own reflection it be obviously a take off of Fred Astaire s shadow dancing in Swing Time but I think Kelly one up it which be hardly believable in fact this have get to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of an American in Paris several year later the rest of the song be also excellent and the musical number be even well too bad Rita do not sing her own song well she may have a couple of they as her singing voice seem to be different sometimes her dancing be wonderful as be the rest of her act it be hard not to love she in anything she be really one of the few truly beautiful woman from the classic era not plastic like many of they no you can really see the warmth in that woman her smile be so disarm Phil Silvers have the role as Kelly s good friend and he be also very funny the trio of Kelly Hayworth Silvers be obviously the kernel which become the Kelly Reynolds OConnor trio in Singin in the Rain eight year afterwards one of the big musical number in the film seem almost completely pilfer with the Good Morning number in Singin I do think Singin in the Rain be the well film as Cover Girl be a little rough around the edge this roughness though just add to the charm there be aspect of this film that beat Singin in the Rain and even an American in Paris for instance the central relationship be more emotionally involve instead of the dominant old man chase the little girl Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds be just teenager after all we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equal there be no chasing around an aspect that do unfortunately turn a lot of the good musical a little sour you have to admit Kelly and Hayworth be a couple from the start and when that begin to fray I really feel it 910,"[[0], [5, 0, 13, 19, 0, 18,

160,this have get to be one of the well post astaire musical make by Columbia produce by Arthur Schwartz and direct by vet Charles Vidor this picture really put Gene Kelly on the map and cement Rita Hayworth s reputation as cinema s premier female dance partner she play a bit of a dual role here since she perform contemporary 1940s number with Gene and co star Phil Silvers but also put she in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th Centrybr br The music should also be single out because this be I believe the last project that the legendary Jerome Kern most famous today for Old Man River and smoke get in your eye work on and his lyricist be the equally legendary Ira Gershwin they supply a score that be full of charm and characterization the music for the historical sequence be especially noteworthy because it be so perfectly style in the early 20th Century idiom that be Kern s original period it be a bit like pick up a record from one of your favorite band from the 1970 and hear they do a song in the original style of that timebr br The story be pretty inconsequential which be fine with I because this film be as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s40s golden age of Broadway musical comedy style on film even the 1940s war propaganda aspect of the film s music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at America s enemy and use period slang such as refer to gremlinsbr br probably the most memorable performance in the film be Kelly s dance to the Alter Ego Dance which find he argue with and then dance with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience this prefigure much of his later work and also stand an effective and memorable scene in and of itselfbr br Fans will want to seek this out for various reason Kelly fan will see this as a rare chance to see he outside of the confine of MGM with a different set of co star and music superior to his usual MGM material hayworth fan will want to see Rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability and fan of classic Broadway musical will definitely want to hear Kern s final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin s lyric and the compatibility of their style this be a definite gem in the crown of Columbia s musical program,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [7, 0, 21, 4], [6,

163,this be a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40 s Cover Girl make Rita Hayworth formerly the dark haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino into a bona fide all american star it confirm Gene Kelly s amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer it epitomise the exuberance and colour of the musical genrebr br Rita Hayworth be great as Rusty Parker it be her picture and her presence be always at the forefront her singing be dub but her dancing be absolutely brilliant and she combine very well with Kelly I think that Rita be highly underrated as an actress she play every scene superbly here gene choreograph the dance sequence he be basically give almost complete creative freedom here and his Alter Ego dance number be amazing such artistry the stand out tune be make way for tomorrow put I to the test and of course Long Ago and Far away the plot be rather thin yet it do have a moral it be about the peril of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factor will ultimately be doom this will cheer you up lift you up to your foot and make you laughbr br that say Cover Girl be not the great musical ever produced it have a number of flaw that must be address one can say that a little bit of Phil Silvers go a long way his character get tedious rather quickly however I be impressed with his dancing ability and how he be able to keep up with Gene and Rita another major problem be that too many song be just not that great the Cover Girl number look fantastic but I be not a fan of the lyric or the singing Poor Tom be a huge downer I think it be one of the bad number I have hear in a 40s50 s musical yet it stink the grandmother sub plot border on be ridiculous but that be only my opinion other may like these elementsbr br still apart from it be fault it be a very very good film much well than most of the product churn out today the dancing and singing be sublime the production value be excellent and it be mood be infectiousbr br 810,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [0], [21, 4, 17, 24], [4, 13, 9, 14, 24, 0, 1, 11, 4], [5, 11, 20, 5, 5, 24], [6, 11, 0, 12, 14, 17, 14, 20, 18], [12, 20, 18, 8, 2, 0, 11], [5, 17, 14,

show in the simple of dance for example his dance with Hayworth to put I to the test or the joyfully exuberant make way for tomorrow number perform by the trio of Danny Rusty and Genius which foreshadow the reaction Gene s character have to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN in the RAIN Kelly especially score a technological and artistic coup with the Alter Ego dance like its successor in ANCHORS AWEIGH and an AMERICAN in PARIS Jerry the Mouse and the 16 minute ballet respectively this dance be an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly bring to the modern film musical want to use the film medium to present dance that could not be showcase on a stage and year before CGI Kelly insist on dance with the one person who could possibly match he in talent and style himself the number be hardly five minute long but it and Kelly s genius still take one s breath away even sixty year down the line this be the reason I watch COVER GIRL and if nothing else this dance be truly worth itbr br You can tell that a great deal of money be lavish onto COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth not that she do not deserve it witness the scene when Rusty hit Broadway the large screen showcase all the different cover girl give way to a staggeringly large stage rig for Rusty s entrance Hayworth be indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girl on show in the film and she dance with a style and grace that be almost worthy of Kelly very few of Kelly s co star have that honour she be hilarious in some scene for example her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to get she from joesbr br For some reason however her performance still lack the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity that curse be only lift whenever Gene Kelly be on the screen dancing or no or when Eve Arden as John s long suffer secretary Stonewall sidle by with another cut comment or clever observation since the film in the end belong to Hayworth neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole this be not to say that the film be bad it be not it be enjoyable with great song and cute number and lot of pretty girl to look at but it be just not quite a classic the dancing be classic though so watch COVER GIRL for that and you will not regret it,"[[17, 8, 19, 0], [7, 0, 24, 22, 14, 17, 19, 7], [0, 18], [17, 20, 18, 19, 24], [15, 0,

powerless to do more than ease his passing the Dresser be really a love story between the two over the year they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other Set during the second world war it concern the fortune of a frankly second rate tour Shakespearean Company comprise an equal number of have been and wannabe lead by Sir a theatrical knight of what might kindly be call the Old School whatever part he be play he grab centre stage and bellow out over the footlight bully his audience into applause but somewhere inside he bury most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dish out there still remain an occasional glitter of his early greatness it be to catch a glimpse of this that his audience fervently hope for Mr AFinney very cleverly concentrate on the ham often to the point of caricature and just when you be ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that make you realise that a great actor be play a great actor the same go for Mr TCourtenay it be easy to write off his portrayal br br of Norman as an exercise in stereotype here we have a middle aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashay his way through life enjoy the company of the girl and love the wicked Insider gossip rife in the theatre there be and I strongly suspect still be many man just like Norman in the Profession infinitely kind and patient know more about the play than many of the actor they run backstage with wisdom and

be rather more subdued than in the movie Sir be play by the great Mr Freddie Jones to huge acclaim from the audience it be a memorable performance that overshadow Mr Courtenays reduce he rather to an also run as oppose to an actor on level billing the idea that Sir and Norman might be almost incomplete without each other go right out of the window Norman be reduce to be his puppet which I be not sure be what Ronald Harwood intend but make for breathtaking theatre Messrs Finney and Courtenay redress the balance in the movie restore equality to the relationship both man have come a long way since their early appearance in the british New Wave picture when they become the darling of the vaguely leftishmiddle class and ashamed of it movement when the british cinema virtually commit Hari

bright lightbr br The Dresser mark their return still fizz with energy and talent shout to the world at large we be still here it be not a big movie but be assuredly a great one,"[[18, 8, 17], [7, 0,

when she find herself pregnant from her late affair she be face with the choice of become a mother and jeopardise her entire police job let alone future advancement or have an abortion which she opt for this abortion never loom large in the ensue drama it be very skilfully deal with in less than a couple of minute screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing but it be always there as a counterpoint to Tennison s desperate effort to find another lose child a kidnap victim before it be too late the story take many twist and turn before the surprise end and one be fascinate alike by the plot and character although I find the many villain a little overdrawn the police and especially Tennison herself be not always competent nor that likeable which figure give the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabitsbr br Mirren herself have say that she will make no more movie in the series but excellent as she be always be in the role of Tennison the series itself be as actor proof as be another addiction of mine Dick Wolf s AmericanLaw Order whoever appear therein each could go on forever as be my fervent hope,"[[8], [1, 4],

difference here like the title imply be that not just the liberated wife but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergo the typical and highly effective Stepford treatment license by the local Men s Association for some reason the scenario attempt to uphold the Stepford mystery until late in the film even though nobody be likely to watch this sequel before having check out the original and presumably everybody also know about the denouement the Harding family be all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford particularly father Steven be excited about their new life because he already live in Stepford and always want to go back ever since his first wife whom his new wife Laura and adolescent child Mary and David know very little about die under mysterious circumstance the town be almost too perfect with picturesque neighbor and model student and especially the modern teenager face huge difficulty to adjust their effort to modernize the place and take the local youth of Stanford in tow cause confrontation with the eminent townsfolk particularly the member of the Men s Association and put the familial relationship under a lot of stress David meet and fall in love with the last normal girl in school Lois but when even she transform into a domestic dummy overnight David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret the first hour of the Stanford Children be slow pace and rather tame but the finale be trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promise and like a late 80 s thriller ought to be in fact the modu operandi behind the Stanford secret be illustrate in great detail and I think horror fan and lover of the original film will appreciate that at least I do the overall plot still do not make a lot of sense and the script be chock full of irrational aspect but it be nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evoke an atmosphere of suspense and fear the act performance be far above average especially the arrogant and obnoxious member of the Men s Association depict plausible character and even teenage player Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performance recommend without hesitation,"[[19, 7, 4], [19, 7, 8, 17, 3], [4, 13, 19, 17, 24], [8, 13], [19, 7, 4], [18, 19, 4, 15, 5, 14, 17, 3], [5, 17, 0, 13,

205,I and my mate use to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before go to the pub it be the only programme that ever make we miss opening time it be one of the good comedy I have ever watch if not the good David Jason be brilliant and be compare many time to Buster Keaton with his clever stunt that be pull off so believably I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again he have an amazing ability to make stupid thing look believable and this series show how much talent he have in so many different direction he be an accomplished trip and fall guy and I remember watch a trailer once where he show people how to do this professionally certainly he be the one to teach people this art he only show glimpse of it in other program he do Pshaw this program show how multi talente he be I be lose as to why David Jason veto another series be make as for my mind it be one of the good thing he have ever do and I have be a fan of his since he do this series it be say he do not like it because it show the rawness of his early career well to my mind that might possibly have be the right decision when he take it but now his career have progress so far I believe this would be a good time for he to do another series show he look back on his secret life full of blunder that he do not see Rod,"[[8], [0, 13, 3], [12, 24], [12, 0, 19, 4], [20, 18, 4], [19,

because they apparently like the people involve br br I tend to like b movie that be original and have heart and I think this be one such work the actor seem to I to be put there heart in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director and they evidently be clear enough in their part of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art br br The critique of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they do not like the film go to this film hope for a lot of TA without patience for the material of the plot be why it be so unenjoyable for they one could say the movie be more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie even though I take it the star have do her share of soft porn I think she graduate br br In term of the writing the dialog be not a huge part of the movie like in a Tarentino film but the plot be decent and the twist be original and sometimes fun particularly the ending be not a disappointment but a pleasure with the villianess heroine and the lead man learn from their complex web of feeling br br I understand that the producer get a 3 film deal out of this hat off for prove a few ten of thousand of dollar can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride br br Gabriella and the other girl with scene of nudity be likable along with be hot not just airhead bimbo so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limit of b movie land not disappointing,"[[14, 13, 4], [19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [19, 7, 0, 19], [2, 14, 12, 4],

210,a fantastic cinema experience I really enjoy see this truly magnificent film in the theater when it come out there be nothing to add except that be a terrible shame that sir Albert Finney still be not accept by the AMPAS American Academy after role in such film as Tom Jones Murder on the Orient Express under the Volcano to name only few for these he be nominate for the Oscar the Dresser be arguably his highlight yet br br I know Oscars be just popularity contest but if american like british actor and actress and the Oscar go to Jeremy Irons Daniel Day Lewis Anthony Hopkins Emma Thompson Glenda Jackson etc and they all deserve the award why they always leave sir Finney with empty handsbr br On the other hand they give it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei in Cousin Vinny I do not know

211,breathtaking at it be good intrigue at it be bad Francis Ford Coppala s groundbreaking epic Apocalypse now be one of the most iconic and celebrate motion picture of the 20th century and in my opinion the great ever film depiction center around America s involvement in Vietnambr br what I like most about Apocalypse now be that it be uniquely different from any other film of the same genre grow up as movie buff and with a particular interest in war film I have see many film which have attempt to portray the image and feeling of Vietnam but have be unsuccessful in do so film such as Hamburger Hill and we be soldier fall into the category of try to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depict heroic battle which be more often than not taint by the zeal of Hollywood film productionbr br In Apocalypse now there be no battle no hero or villain there be nothing in the film that suggest that it be intend to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspect of war rather it be a film which powerfully investigate and explore the human psyche when it have be torment by the absolute horror of what be the darkest military conflict of the previous centurybr br The sheer brilliance of the acting in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen along with the spectacular cinematography film in the Phillipines which provide crucial realism to the backdrop of the film make Apocalypse now an unforgettable epicbr br evoke a myriad of emotion and leave we with a maelstrom of mediation Apocalypse now be not for the light hearted moviegoer it be masterpiece that demand multiple viewing to be fully appreciate,"[[1, 17, 4, 0, 19, 7, 19, 0, 10, 8, 13, 6], [0, 19], [8, 19], [1, 4], [6, 14, 14, 3], [8, 13, 19, 17, 8, 6, 20, 4], [0,

212,this be a classic war movie one of the good a stark image f of flash light harrowing dark background and helicopter blade morph into ceiling fan a star studded spectacle of immense powerbr br Martin Sheen be a mercenary send up river to assassinate the general go astray a sadistic dictator play beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando also along for the ride be Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it Dennis Hopper be an edgy photojournalist with a view slant view about the war and about his leader also in this amazing film you will see up and come star such as Laurence Fishburne R Lee Ermey Sam Bottoms Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford too br br behind the lens be Francis Ford Coppolla deliver a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather film he highlight war in it s most basic form which for the most part be something you can not see you can only feel it as the boat carry on up river the feeling of the war tightening in be quite unbearable the feeling of this be a rather claustrophobic feeling and really make for unusual mood from the viewer honestly no film have ever make I feel like thatbr br criticism be hard to find the big qualm from some be that Brando earn ton of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this be unjustified it be money well earn a role that physically restrict he be at the time an unwell man and a role that he really make his own I can not picture anyone well for the role and if you get the Apocalypse now Redux version there be some extra bit of the great man and I think the Redux do make the film mile betterbr br final impression be that if you be lucky to get the Redux version then you will be bless with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minute extra footage if not then still you will not be disappoint this film be up there with the good and deserve some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 film ever make,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [0], [2, 11, 0, 18, 18, 8, 2], [22, 0, 17], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [14, 13, 4], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [6, 14, 14, 3], [0], [18, 19, 0, 17, 10],

213,this be an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world the social criticism of our shallow commercially orient value be what make this film an exceptional vision of the war be hell clich underscore by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special force captain whose mission be to eliminate with extreme prejudice a rogue colonel who be leave behind the army s concept of justice to create his own world when I see Apocalypse now in 1980 I think it be a deeply flawed masterpiece in particular I find the final segment of the journey with Brando which encapsulate Conrad s Heart of Darkness to be rather boring I finally get around to see Apocalypse now Redux and the flaw have be take care of Redux make the movie an outright masterpiece certainly among the top 100 film ever make Brando s performance now seem full and complete perhaps rather less mysterious but much more profound Martin Sheen be brilliant at the heart of one of the good acting ensemble ever assemble it be great to spot a young Harrison Ford Scott Glenn etc in early screen performance that suggest what fine actor they will eventually be recognize as the work of Robert Duvall Fred Forrest Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms be greatly enhance by the additional footage if you have never see this film skip the original and head straight for Redux I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from

220,it be that film that load of people hail as a classic Apocalypse now now a re cut re up Redux 22 year after it be original releasebr br The film be loosely base on Conrad s Heart of Darkness it be main plot if it have one be Capt Willard s journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel Colonel Kurtz we see the character and situation he meet and he tell the Colonel s story along the waybr br My initial feeling towards the film be that it be not particularly grip at time especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy be put in in the form of surf fanatic Col Kilgore as the film progress however a good deal of tension be build up with Willard s reading through various report on Col Kurtz until the end be in sight when everything come together and the atmosphere of the film reach an incredible level and hold it there until the endbr br The usual aspect everyone look for in a decent film be all of a good standard Cinematography in particular stand out as exceptional and I find the performance of Martin Sheen Marlon Brando Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention the score I find initially sound out of place but as the film progress I be not entirely sure if it do actually get well or it fit well or if it have just grow on I but by the end of the film I be thoroughly enjoy itbr br this be the second time I have see the Redux version I have see the original around four time I will say now that the first time I see it I be disappointed I be expect a classic film with lot of war the fact that Willard get the mission at the beginning of the film and do not carry it out until the end have I bore because all of the character interaction on the way that be the film seem unnecessary this be due to the fact that the plot be not entirely define as the focus be more on the character and the journey more than the plot in most case a second viewing be need to appreciate the film fully as with all film that be more character than plot base as the second time around you know where the plot be go I have a similar experience with it be a wonderful life which be now one of my favourite filmsbr br with the big four Vietnam film Apocalypse now win over the rest on atmosphere but lack the action and involvement of Platoon the emotional intensity of the Deer Hunter and can not really be compare to Full Metal Jacket probably my favourite of the four apocalypse now be a great piece of work especially towards the end where it become staggering and be to be recommend for anyone who enjoy a good character base film and do not mind some casual violence,"[[8, 19], [1, 4], [19, 7, 0, 19], [5, 8, 11, 12], [19, 7, 0, 19], [11, 14, 0, 3], [14, 5], [15, 4, 14, 15, 11, 4], [7, 0, 8, 11], [0, 18],

definitely under appreciated until the day your boat sink that isbr br The movie be very enjoyable and fun Kevin Costner be perfect as the age macho man who do not know when to quit however I be most impressed by Ashton Kutcher s performance I have never like he never watch any of his tv show and always consider he an immature well punk in this film he do a great job he be well on his way to have lead man status I think the film we be show must have be an advance rough cut or something because about 23 of the way in the film stock turn very grainy the sound level drop and microphone be see drop down all over the place also at the viewing be representative from the movie look for audience feedback particularly on the part of the film we do not likebr br POSSIBLE SPOILER the feedback I

225,I decide I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film unlike other war film that focus on the event Apocalypse now take the viewer into a psychological head trip the sheer surrealism make the body uncomfortable yet you can not lay your eye off of it base off of Joseph Conrad s Heart of Darkness Apocalypse now slowly descend its protagonist Willard Martin Sheen into madness most likely the same way Kurtz plunge into insanity the production of this film be notorious for its delay provide by the monsoon season and for Brando s unprepared performance he read his line from cue card there be a documentary title apocalypse now a filmmaker apocalypse which show the hell everyone go through in make thisbr br The opening sequence be one of the most famous and popular in any film as the blade of the helicopter be hear in slow motion and napalm be drop in the tree the song the end by the door can be hear the next shot be of Willard in his bed with the fan on so the noise of the helicopter coincide with the fan we be inform that he do special mission for the military mostly assassination when his next mission be give to he he be baffle charge a man with murder here be like give a speed ticket in the Indy 500 the man he have to kill be a respected colonel that have go insane and isolate himself along with tribe people Kurtz be order atrocious act that be carry out by these people and he must I stop Willard do not go alone however he be carry on a boat with several soldier and they come across several battle along the way they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore Hoorah about the war Willard ponder that if Kilgore be that crazy what could Kurtz be like there be many scene that portray willard plunge into insanity the tiger attack the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese the nonstop rain the piled dead body scatter about and the death of his crew member when he reach the Kurtz compound he be greet by the village people and a hippie photojournalist Dennis Hopper instead of assassinate Kurtz right away Willard begins talk with he and his conscience begin to doubt what he should do Kurtz on the other hand want to die he be tired of the war and want to go down as a soldier Willard kill he with a machete while in unison a buffalo be sacrifice with several machete by the people once they realize their leader have be slay instead of kill Willard they hail he as their new king Willard reject the offer and leave thembr br The cinematography here be absolutely breathtaking the color be grain free something that be rare in old movie I can watch it mute and admire the beauty of the scenerybr br The act ensemble be terrific with everyone play their part well many criticize Brando for some reason but I think he nail his role as a depressed lunatic who be beat up by the warbr br The soundtrack and the score be haunt and provide the mood for the film I be wonder what instrument they use in that guitar like sound when the credit roll there have be many parody of this film but my favorite quote come from Marge Simpson when she explain to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show be behave like an idiot your character provide comic relief for the show like um Marlon Brando in Apocalypse now those who have see the movie know why this be hilarious,"[[8], [3, 4, 2, 8, 3, 4], [8], [13, 4, 4, 3], [19, 14],

227,even with all the cinema deal with the trauma of the Vietnam War Jacob s Ladder the Deer Hunter Apocalypse now and Taxi Driver to an extent one feel that we do not even know the half of what happen even contemplate the horror feel inhuman and a progression or retreat to the inhumanity that it necessitate be a key part of Apocalypse now Coppola s great and one of the most important film ever make loosely base on Joseph Conrad s 1902 classic heart of Darkness which chronicle the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that come with distance from civilization a surfacing of a bestial nature as it be a la Lord of the Flies it bring the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam the story be of Willard a general commission on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam be serve Willard at the beginning of the film be stick in Saigon psychologically unable to go back home eerily echo Nicky in the Deer Hunter so he be contact his mission be to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who have isolate himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River and who have purportedly go completely insane worship like a god by the native and kill indiscriminately this man s name be Colonel Kurtz play by Marlon Brando in the second good role of his career the good be Stanley Kowalski in a Streetcar Named Desire as Willard journey upriver in an army boat with some soldier accompany his witness the horror and the insanity and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all lead to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet by the time they do Kurtz s method do not really seem as wrong or as they should and they certainly do not seem too unusual or out of place apocalypse a place beyond morality the outpost on the end of the world the loss of civilization the loss of judgement of self Kurtz s monologue about an atrocity he witness as a Green Beret and his later revelation be one of the most chilling and well deliver speech in cinema history the film be about trauma about the human spirit and its breaking point here it be a lot like the Deer Hunter and just as good apocalypse however take the boundary of what we can endure to a global level Coppola s sweeping footage of the humid murky jungle of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopter amid explode forest and an orange sky set to an oddly fitting door soundtrack as well as chilling scene on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speaker a scene which have go down as one of the most chilling darkly humorous and strikingly pointless war scene ever this all contribute to the sense of Apocalypse the end of the world and not at some distant point in the future but Apocalypse now and forever the Deer Hunter be much more up close and personal you can even tell by the title and show the totalling effect trauma have on the individual psyche the breaking down of the human soul and its ability to either surrender completely to force of darkness or to limp on this be why both film be equal they be two part of the same thing in heart of Darkness Kurtz be show as conflict between morality civilization and his inner savage in Apocalypse now Kurtz have leave all conflict behind he be beyond good and evil he have let go of morality like a drown man let go of a save hand in the moment before his death Kurtz indeed be only wait for death quote T S Eliot in his temple to himself lose in the jungle his last word and the word echo at the end of the movie be the horror the horror he be refer to the infinite void of existence of the human psyche and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind where atrocity be bear again it be impossible to express in word the experience one go through watch this film the experience in short that Willard experience on his journey the end part at the outpost almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in the Deer Hunter be one of the most deeply calmly and seductively disturb thing I have ever see,"[[4, 21, 4, 13], [22, 8, 19, 7], [0, 11, 11], [19, 7, 4], [2, 8, 13, 4, 12, 0], [3, 4, 0, 11], [22, 8, 19, 7], [19, 7, 4], [19, 17, 0, 20, 12, 0], [14,

psychological horror story of the late 20th century post modernist variety the cast and crew who work on it probably could relate to the terrifying place the human mind can achieve this be the plight of Joseph Conrad s original character Kurtz who come into literary being in 1901 and subsequently reference in TS Eliot s the Hollow Men Mistah Kurtz he dead of 1925 although neither a straight telling of Conrad s Heart of Darkness 1901 nor a first hand account of the Vietnam experience Apocalypse now stand as a masterpiece which push on the envelope of cinematic potential apocalypse be not just about the horror of war per se like Platoon and the Deer Hunter but the dark sensibility of human nature as reveal through the raw and demeaning confrontation of violent conflict on a mass scale Apocalypse now be not so much see as experiencedbr br The bulk of the movie be the journey of a train secret assassin Captain Benjamin Willard Martin Sheen in a tour de force performance aboard a US military boat traverse an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerner would ever tread his mission be to terminate Colonel Kurtz Marlon Brando a career army Special Forces

aspect of this film be its pacing the original release not the later Redux version do a fine of job of building until the viewer be emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz the strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz be worth the price of admission alone and some of the shot of both Sheen and Brando in certain place be some of the starkest and terrifying image ever produce on film not even the like of Clive Barker Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in term of horrific imagery Brando s Kurtz in one scene in particular be so utterly terrify it make most other horror movie seem tame by comparison which come from the recognition that the horror be not from without but from withinbr br without give too much away Coppola s solution to the climactic moment stand as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelation accord to the documentary heart of Darkness Coppola fear that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movie s dark hue would be compromise he be not sure how he could make it work until his wife encourage the director to witness the ceremonial

simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequence in the history of american film making love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after see this scenebr br this film be not for all taste just as Conrad s original novel be not the kind of book that will be read on airplane it be not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that be difficult for most american viewer to absorb it be the naked unveiling of aspect of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban american life that make this film difficult for the average movie goer to handle which be as it should be Coppola do not make a family picture however if the viewer can understand its large point there be a lot to be get out of Apocalypse now if you be look for a film experience to reaffirm pre existing attitude about american sensibility and heroism well stick with John Wayne but if you be willing to be take into place you have never be even beyond the evil of war rhetoric Apocalypse now will take you into a world you think you would never visit before and the disturbing part of it be that you may recognize it,"[[12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [18, 4, 4, 12], [19, 14], [5, 0, 11, 11], [8, 13, 19, 14], [19,

229,Captain Willard Martin Sheen have be send on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz Marlon Brando as he have go completely insane and be no long take order and since Kurtz be one of the most decorate man in the armed force it be hard for Capt Willard to understand how Col Kurtz could go off the deep end as he have kill without clearance and take the war into his own hand what possibly could have push this great man over the top through Willard s long journey through the jungle to find his target he try with some success to understand why but what will he decide to do once he find himbr br Any movie that can start out with the door the end be a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery show with the song apocalypse now do this perfectly I can not think of anything well for it to be set to the Vietnam War and the insanity in the solider mind that it create an be a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairy jungle in Vietnam the ultimate destination of which be murder through it be use of music and score alone we be throw into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone be this film right here br br an overall great cast with the exception of Laurence Fishburne of which Sheen and Brando give we more than enough acting skill to spread around on our movie desire bread I just do not like Fishburne ever since I find out he be Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee s playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man have increase ten fold I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care we need to sick Gary Oldman on he Brando be excellent as Col Kurtz and I can not think of any other actor that could have play the good man go insane and hold such screen presence Sheen be also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie have to be Robert Duvall s Lt Colonel Kilgore before this film I never picture Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it be my favorite of his part to date he simply nail his character which be one of the good in the entire film as the gung ho Air Cavalry commander who love to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant I also love the smell of napalm in the morningbr br the plot be a fairly simple one and it do not take too much brainpower to figure out what be go on Willard s mission be to kill Kurtz plain and simple but it be the journey of the film that be really it be heart and also the dire situation of war itself in the Redux version we be force to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really add nothing to the film s entirety other than it make it a long journey I do not feel they take away anything though it be just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film point out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it have on the soldier who fight in it in fact that be the entire point on top of that the troop be not support by the public and that could very well have help cause a character like Kurtz to go completely mad br br A big war movie lover this one be up there with Platoon and the Deer Hunter all of they classic I sometimes try to compare film of the same genre to one another but it have get I in trouble in the past in my review as I have have to go back on what I have say all three have their own strength and add their own twist to the Vietnam War so to really say one be well than the other be fairly pointless even if after having most recently view AN I think it be a tad well in the end Apocalypse now be a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it be be give as a fellow reviewer have previously state AN be one of the most ambitious film ever make,"[[2, 0, 15, 19, 0, 8, 13], [22, 8, 11, 11, 0, 17, 3], [12, 0, 17, 19, 8, 13], [18, 7, 4, 4, 13], [7, 0, 21, 4], [1, 4], [18, 4, 13, 3], [14, 13], [0], [2, 11, 0, 18, 18, 8, 5, 8, 4,

230,spoiler this review have be edit due to word limitbr br The horror the horror Marlon Brando Apocalypse now 1979 and Apocalypse now Redux 2001br br the sentence which be as famous as here be look at you kid or be you talkin to I or may the Force be with you or I will be back mean a little more than some one liner when it be speak it linger in the air with an importance and meaning that do not go unnoticed what might drive some viewer nuts be that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single framebr br What exactly do this line of dialogue mean the horror speak of be the reality of war the reality of moral man be so easily corrupt that they turn on their inborn instinct and kill fellow being without any sign of guilt when Capt Willard Martin Sheen stand before the die Col Kurtz Marlon Brando at the end of the film the horrorthe horror be the realization of Willard s corruptness he have mercilessly kill a man in cold blood as part of his assignment this be not a typical Hollywood ending in most case a character gain something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three but Willard both gain and lose he gain the knowledge that he have lose his moral and that be a shocking endingbr br Apocalypse now be Francis Ford Coppola s tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking this film be wholly different from the Godfather it be hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature at first it seem realistic and then it become strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare this be not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it be a film about the war within usbr br at first it do appear to be another war film Captain Willard Sheen be assign by an Army Lieutenant a young Harrison Ford to assassinate a renegade American Colonel name Kurtz Brando who be hide out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troop who more or less act as his slavesbr br Willard carry out his mission with extreme prejudice head out on a boat along with four soldier include the boat captain Chief Albert Hall Chef Frederic Forest and a very young Larry Fishburne who later go on to appear as Morpheus in the matrixbr br Apocalypse now be in a many way a modern update of Homer s odyssey as our main character Willard carry on his journey he meet an array of original and strange character include Lt Col Kilgore Robert Duvall who have a strange fetish for surfing and a stone photographer Dennis Hopper whose lively gesture and mannerism can be compare to those of the very much less Jeremy davy in The Million Dollar Hotel one of the bad film I have ever see davy fail to make any connection with an audience Hopper do he be like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz he be like an interpreter go back and forth and speak in foreign language in this case he be translate Kurtz to Willard although I be not so sure Kurtz need a translation of Willardbr br Many film be lucky enough to have one or two memorable scene or line Apocalypse now have many Kilgore descend upon a Vietnam village play Wagner s Ride of the valkyrie remain one of the most remembered scene in all of film history there be sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness when Kilgore kneel down on that beach and say I love the smell of napalm in the morningit smell like victory we all crack a smilebr br i will not lie to you Apocalypse now be a strange film it be not exactly the easy thing to analyze the end may frustrate some viewer if they do not understand Marlon Brando s significant speech but what it all come down to what really matter be that this film be about the dark nature of the human psyche the horror be the realization of war and its effect not the war itself Kurtz say you have a right to kill I but you have no right to judge I Brando s character Kurtz be leave to the audience to judge to many nave viewer he may appear as a crazy loon whose power get to his head but that be not what Francis Ford Coppola be try to get across by fight in Vietnam Kurtz have realize just how great he have it and how bad some other have it by walk through devastate village he eventually come to realize that we be the nave one live our life in a fool s paradise we be totally nave to our surrounding and possible misfortune until they hit by see how unlucky some Vietnamese be Kurtz realize just how easily he could be strike by something just how easily he could end up like the people around he and he also realize that the people who do this be people who have abandon their moral and leave they at the door many people think the horror be one thing it be two for Kurtz the horror be the reality of how nave he be and the reality of the war s impact upon man and after Willard murder Kurtz and hear Kurtz s die word he realize it too he realize the effect of war to see so many soldier with no sense of right or wrong make he realize the horror of what war can do to a man and what it have do to he the horrorbr br 55 star br br,"[[18, 15, 14, 8, 11, 4, 17], [19, 7, 8,

231,well I have watch this movie for over 25 year now and it be still almost as interesting as when I first see it it be definitely one of the most unique film ever madebr br I still think Martin Sheen get diss big time in the billing too he dominate the film yet get less billing than Marlon Brando who only appear in the last 30 minute of this 2 hour 17 minute film theatrical version how unfair be thatbr br Sheen be fantastic in here especially his narration which run throughout it be one of the good narration if not the good I have ever hear in a movie his voice be just haunt as he relate his thought on this incredible nightmare like adventure I never fail to appreciate his work in this moviebr br The other thing that strike I about the film over the year be the number of memorable scene one I have never forget such as br br sheen lose it in his hotel room in the movie s first scene Robert Duvall and the totally out of place surfing scene and then the ensue attack with Wagner s dramatic classical music blare out of the helicopter the Playboy bunny entertain the troop Frederic Forrest being freak out see a tiger close up in the jungle the weird scene on the long riverboat ride the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greet the crew in Cambodia and then Brando s bizarre character it go on and on with strange scenesbr br That be not to say I enjoy everything no there be a few very unpleasant scene such as the one in which an ox be slice in half can not watch that anymore an innocent family be slaughter on a small boat by Sheen s young stone out crew and the crew be a little too goofy at time then there be the huge amount of profanity lead by way too many f wordsbr br So there be a lot of good and a lot of bad thing in this movie for almost anyone who watch this one thing for sure it be a film you will remember,"[[22, 4, 11, 11], [8], [7, 0, 21, 4], [22, 0, 19, 2, 7], [19, 7, 8, 18], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [5, 14, 17], [14, 21, 4, 17], [28,

232,from all of the Vietnam war movie this be probably the most frightening and disturbing and that be really say a lot with so many spectacular one that have come out it have this freakish feel to it everything be so chaotic in the movie it scare you it be not like it show a lot of different thing compare to the other Vietnam war movie what do push to such a high level be the br br The directing be spectacular here Francis Ford Coppola show of his talent in his last epic movie unlike other director he make you feel as if you be in the war Most other just display and show you the horror of war Coppola though make you feel confused shocked and scared these feeling of war be usually tell to we from a movie or story this be something that I have only experience very few time while watch a film the writing be of course amazing too it bring you write into the middle of the movie it never make I bored and this movie be three hour the cinematography go hand in hand with the directing which very much add to the freakish experience of watch this film show all the chaos around you even when everything seem calmbr br The acting be bone chilling just look at Marlon Brando also give his last great performance play a deluded out of whack colonel when ever I think of a crazy go make soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse now with Brando n this film you do not want to look into his eye like the movie he be freakish to I this performance be as memorable as the one he give in the Godfather Martin Sheen give a very deep performance and probably the good one of his career make you see everything through his eye all the craziness he be experience and yet want he to get to his goal it be just a wonder why these two do not get Oscar nomination Robert Duvall be able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategy among those play music to tell the enemy he be come also Duvall s character ask one of the soldier to surf in the middle of a battle be just shocking but believable other great support performance be give by a young Laurence Fishburne Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all sum up the attitude of many of the soldier at that time without become a clich also for once cameo be put into good use have Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both lovebr br i would definitely recommend people to watch this movie it have a message and everyone involve in the making of it be at their good there be nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting direct writing cinematography and great ending watch and you will see why it live up to its title Apocalpyse now,"[[5, 17, 14, 12], [0, 11, 11], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [21, 8, 4, 19, 13, 0, 12], [22, 0, 17], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [15, 17, 14, 1, 0, 1, 11, 24], [19, 7, 4],

236,somewhere on IMDb there be a discussion about the great director of all time Spielberg Copolla and other be name there the great argument be around Spielberg and whether he be or be not a great director the problem with Spielberg be that while he be a master technician most of his film lack depth Saving Ryan be really outstanding from a technical point of view but its message be dull and while its very entertaining it do not make you think about anything an be the good movie I ever see because it combine great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many thing start from war in general the clash of civilization the condition of soldier in wartime be a soldier a hero or an assassin Brando say he be neither the french lady say he be both and many other the problem with some people be that they try to argue about whether these point be true or false but a great movie and a great piece of art in general be suppose to spark argument not to solve they maybe Coppola be right or maybe he be not nobody hold the truth anyway you can watch this movie for its outer beauty amazing scene great act and memorable quote and you will be entirely satisfied but what really make this movie a masterpiece be its inner quality you can not help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issue but while Copolla present matter from an outside objective point of view Moore take a very partisan position that really compromise the whole point of a documentary it be really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 911 win a prestigious award like Cannes but anyway if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war the Iraq war the second World War and any war in general you should definitely see this movie and not the other one,"[[18, 14, 12, 4, 22, 7, 4, 17, 4], [14, 13], [8, 12, 3, 1], [19, 7, 4, 17, 4], [1, 4], [0], [3, 8, 18, 2, 20, 18, 18, 8, 14, 13], [0, 1, 14, 20, 19], [19, 7, 4], [6, 17, 4, 0,

proportion as ambitious as the film s production levelsbr br opene with no credit and follow a memorable first scene play to the tune of the door the end as Martin Sheen s Captain Benjamin L Willard hallucinate to image of helicopter and napalm the plot be essentially lay out in the first 15 minute Willard s mission be to terminate with extreme prejudice Colonel Kurtz Marlon Brando who have invariably go awol in the far reach of the cambodian jungle and as tell by his general be out there operate without any decent restraint totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct and he be still in the field command troop Kurtz be a delusional Colonel now be worship by a large group of follower who have dub he a god for Willard this covert operation seem somewhat more manageable than actual combat yet the journey he be about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limit of his human behaviorbr br teame up with a small crew they embark down the vast reach of the river in a rickety boat along the way Willard educate himself on all thing Kurtz during Sheen s raspy voice over he detail his thought on the abundance of material he read Kurtz be a highly decorate and respected Green Beret he be a normal man with a family until a part of he succumb to the horror of human brutality and he lead himself down the path that Willard be be lead the descent into the jungle be mark by a mesmerize aura that echo the battle be fight not to far away eventually the power of the experience weight on the group as drug and a sort of solitary confinement attack their

Willard s slow decay will parallel that of Kurtzsbr br Marlon Brando have be revere for decade his presence unmatchable his genius undeniable but for those unacquainted with his act prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance Brando can be perceive in the eye of an uncompromise film goer as a hack he be most certainly not Brando be difficult to work with hard to interpret and impossible to understand but his talent for unintelligible rant and unparalleled monologue be irrefutable the man obviously know what he be do even if we do not his Colonel Kurtz be a being of limitless delusion and continual profunditybr br if the film be any indication of the journey into hell than Francis Ford Coppola s actual experience with make this masterpiece be a true life account of one man s fanatical struggle to produce a movie it be report that during the film s 200 plus day principle photography schedule Coppola contemplate suicide the film be not only an undeniable struggle to make it be a gruele film to watch Coppola s sweat and blood seep through the pore of the steamy local and his dedication filter through the orifice of Martin Sheen s haunted soldier Willardbr br I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film at the dawn of all that be original and unprecedented film that challenge as well as stimulate be commonplace audacity aside Apocalypse now be pure film making my respect and admiration for Mr Coppola be of the high order but I shudder at the return to what have become the norm for today s standard for film a lack of innovation it be not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today it be the fact that nobody seem to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart but we still have the great one like Coppola s masterpiece a film which bathe in its ability to give we something deep than that which we could comprehendbr br that depth in Apocalypse now be the step into madness the killing can disturb the loss of innocence can unhinge but it be the damage from within the countless barrage of image that distress unnerve and detach we from our everyday world and the memory that plague our deep thought that eventually segregate we from humanity and propel we into the realm of the instinctual the savage and the animalistic if the thought of killing do not provide sustenance the act of killing provide man with its fundamental catharsis,"[[5, 17, 0, 13, 2, 8, 18], [5, 14, 17, 3], [2, 14, 15, 15, 14, 11, 0], [18], [0, 15, 14, 2, 0, 11, 24, 15, 18, 4], [13, 14, 22], [1, 4], [13, 14, 19], [0], [21, 8, 4,

239,Apocalypse now Redux Francis Ford Coppola s war opus be probably the most beautiful war film I have ever see Capt Benjamin Willard Martin Sheen be a Vietnam soldier who be tap to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to terminate the position of Col Kurtz Marlon Brando a highly ranked and highly regard army man who seemingly have go completely insane and defect from the army set up his own little society and help by a cultish following of soldier escort he up the river to Cambodia be a handful of navy man and along the way they encounter several interesting people most notably be Robert Duvall s Kilgore a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screw loose and some horrify situation br br Apocalypse be less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study it be more full Metal Jacket than Platoon the running time of Apocalypse be over three hour but the film be so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrive I be actually surprised at the amount of time that have pass the beautiful cinematography be surely what stand out the most for I however after see this film I be convinced that Coppola be one of the master of light and photography in film history the Godfather film be all tinge with an almost sepia tone and shadow create the feeling of a Baroque composition with apocalypse there be an incredible usage of natural light and the shadow particularly in the scene involve Brando and Sheen almost become a live character they be so pervasive and effective another gorgeous scene be when Cpt Willard and Jay Hicks Frederic Forrest be in the jungle look for mango and come across a tiger the sheer enormity of the surround foliage leave as big as a house make the character almost lilliputian but the colorization of the scene be incredible while everything else be almost a muted grey the leave be an incredibly vibrant green an effect that be particularly strike another really minor positive moment in the film be the great scene when the helicopter carry Duvall and company attack the small village while play Wagner this could have just be an ultra dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead Coppola turn the song into an actual part of the scene with Duvall mention that he like to play it while they be approach to scare the hell out of they br br The performance in apocalypse be first class much have be make of the amount of money Brando earn for the film and the amount of trouble he cause regardless of this he turn out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time Sheen be completely outstanding this be the first time I have see he really unleash in a film and Duvall be a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore Apocalypse now be a film that be so pervasive in pop culture by now most know several choice line from the film I love the smell of napalm in the morning et al but I know little enough about it that there be plenty of surprise leave to experience I have not see the original cut of Apocalypse now so I can not compare it to this new cut but this be a film that should most certainly be experience 810 br br shelly,"[[0, 15, 14, 2, 0,

241,as I peruse through the hundred of comment that loyal reader of the IMDB have post on this film I find it very interesting how few middle of the road comment there be everyone either love it or they hate it having see Apocalypse now approximately 30 time and having recently dissect it on DVD how do we ever live without those magical digital machine I can say without hesitation that I be one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film why would you like a film that be so confusing ask many of my associate the answer be this forget the war forget the brutality this be a classic story of society protect itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo Brando represent the individual that have his own way of get the job do they Big Brother send he out to do the job he do it too well without adhere to the accepted standard of death and destruction be I the only one who be trouble by the fact that we have standard for death and destruction so they send the Conformity Police out to eliminate the individual Hmmmmmm draw any parallel between this and thing you see every day with the deep respect to Mr Coppola whom I believe be one of the good director of all time I think he transcend his original intent of the movie and probably do not even realize it until after the movie be release the subtle sub text that permeate the entire movie have way too much to it to have be plan and portray instead it seem to have grown itself like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden again I must reiterate I think FF Coppola do a bang up job on this entire production as do the cast and crew but the sum of the movie exceed the individual effort ten fold so if you have not see the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more time and look for all the generic parallel to everyday life only then make a judgment on the quality of the film those of you that have see it watch it again with the mindset previously describe I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film or maybe not no matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story tell style,"[[0, 18],

242,I first see apocalypse now in 1985 when it be broadcast on british television for the first time I be shell shocked after see this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the like of FELLOWSHIP of the ring this movie still remain my all time favourite nearly 20 year after I first see it br br This lead to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie I could praise the technical aspect especially the sound editing and cinematography but everyone else seem to have praise rightly too these achievement to high heaven while the performance in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also be note and everyone else have mention the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat travel upriver after pass through the border br br How about the script Francis Ford Coppola be well know as a director but he be everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he be as a director I say be in the past tense because make this movie seem to have burn out every creative brain cell in his head but his sacrifice be worth it in John Milius original solo draft we have a script that be just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen but Coppola s involvement in the screenplay have inject a narrative that exactly mirror that of war check how the screenplay start off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who would not have look out of place in the GREEN BERETS but the more the story progress the more shocking and insane everything become so much so that by the time reach Kurtz outpost the audience be watch another film in much the same way as the character have sail into another dimension when Coppola state this movie be not about Vietnam it be Vietnam he be right what start off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960 have by the film s setting the Manson trial suggest it be 1970 have change America s view of both the world and itself and of the world s view of America br br It be the insane beauty of apocalypse now that make it a masterwork of cinema and say more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politician what do you do in the Vietnam War Mr President than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime I have not see the REDUX version but watch the original print I do not feel there be anything miss from the story which like all truly great film be very basic in fact the premise can lend itself to many other genre like a western where an army officer have to track down and kill a renegade colonel who be lead an injun war party or a sci fi movie where a UN assassin be to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who be lead a resistance movement on Mars though this be probably down to Joseph Conrad s original source novel br br My all time favourite movie and it be very fitting that I choose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb,"[[8], [5, 8, 17, 18, 19], [18, 4, 4], [0, 15, 14, 2, 0, 11, 24, 15, 18, 4], [13,

243,my favourite movie of all time this be a flawed piece of work by Coppola and see the documentary Heart of Darkness make it even more compelling Coppola at this point be king of Hollywood after make the Godfather and godfatherii and have develop the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like Apocalypse now through sheer arrogance he go to the Phillipines with a partial script and think he would know what he would do when he get there just as Captain Willard think he would know what to do once he get to Col Kurtz s compound and just like Willard he DIDNT know what he be go to do once he get there this be such a masterpiece of american cinema beautifully photographed and the river be such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story what I like most about Apocalypse now be that it offer no answer or conclusion consequently because of this open endedness it infuriate some viewer who like their movie to be much more obvious br br this movie defy categorization some call it a war movie which it be not at all really it be more of a personal study of man the good pic about Vietnam be Platoon in my opinion and if a viewer be seek a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answer br br Coppola should be commend for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he convey quite effectively with the meeting with Gen Corman and Lucas Harrison Ford and the Playmate review the sheer audacity of Kilgore make he an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classicbr br It be an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which make it a movie not accessible to everyone very challenging to watch but rewarding as well I could offer my explanation on each scene but that would be totally pointless this movie be intend for interpretation and contemplation as oppose to immediate gratificationbr br a little footnote definitely if your a first time viewer of Apocalypse now watch the original version first the Redux version be I think more intend for the hardcore fan and be more of a curiosity than a new and improve version of the movie,"[[12, 24], [5, 0, 21, 14, 20, 17, 8, 19, 4], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [14, 5], [0, 11,

244,I just watch the Dresser this evening having only see it once before about a dozen year agobr br it be not a big movie and do not try to make a big splash but my God the brilliance of the two lead leave I just about speechless Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay be nothing less than amazing in this moviebr br The Dresser be the story of Sir an age shakespearean actor Finney and his dresser Norman Courtenay sort of a valet put on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II these be two man each dependent upon the other Sir be almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully he into get onstage for his 227th performance of Lear and Norman live his life vicariously through Sir without Sir to need he he be nothing or think he be anywaybr br this be a character drive film the plot be secondary to the interaction of the character and as such it require actor of the high caliber to bring it to life Finney only 47 year old be completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hiss and fume at his fellow actor even when they be take their bow and Courtenay be no less convincing as the mince dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer Employer be really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship be that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old marry couplebr br Yes there be other in the cast of this movie but there be no question that the true star be Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood that be not to say that there be not other fine performance most notably Eileen Atkins as the long suffer stage manager Madge there be a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desire old regret and what might have beenbr br Although it do not get talk about these day it be worth remember that the Dresser be nominate for five Academy Awards Best Actor nomination for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director Peter Yates and Best Adapted Screenplaybr br I have remember this as be a good movie but I be not prepared to be as completely mesmerize as I be from begin to end if you want to see an example of what great acting be all about and be hugely entertain all the while then I encourage you to see the Dresser,"[[8], [9, 20, 18,

247,last night I see a peck on the cheek kannathil MUTHAMITTAL with english subtitle oddly it be 137 minute long slightly long than the time list on IMDbbr br At first I find myself lose interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lose I the context for what be occur be miss and I be glad I stick with it at the beginning a young couple be married and shortly after the wedding war break out in their native Sri Lanka and the lover be separate month later the wife be very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel head to India at a refugee center you see the lady about to give birth after which the title to the film finally be revealedbr br The entire focus of the film then change completely to a young girl who be about to turn 9 in Madras India you see she in her home and she talk to the camera about her life and family none of this seem that interesting or important and you wonder what be miss what about the lady who be about to give birth my wife and I debate this and we finally guess that this little girl be actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film somehow or another she have be adopt and be talk about her life with mom and dad 2 though she do not realize these people be not her biological parentsbr br Soon after this the parent reveal themselves to be total idiot one of the complaint I have about the film as they decide to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage and tell it in a way that leave the girl emotionally screw up and confuse despite a stupid decision and tell she in the bad way the parent make up for this by agree to help she find her biological mother see the impact all this have on the girl and parent particularly the adoptive mother be impressive to watch and sure spark my interestbr br unfortunately Sri Lanka have be involve in a very very long and brutal civil war with tamilese militant off and on for three decade the family s decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka be indeed noble but also a bit stupid at time as they take so many risk and nearly get kill again and again by just blindly jump into the middle of a war this be all exciting and captivate but also leave I wonder about the sanity of the adoptive parent first you tell she she isnt your biological child and now you take she in the middle of a WAR zone sure the kid really want to meet her biological mother but this really be stupid in hind sight if it be I I might have be tempt to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid thus avoid be in the middle of a warbr br Despite my complaint the film be lovely to watch and be very rewarding far from perfect it sure hit an emotional home run also while I expect this because I have see several indian film many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid song that seem to come out of no where this be standard in most film from India include those make in Bollywood Bombay and Tamilwood Kollywood Madras,"[[11, 0, 18, 19], [13,

between all the various member of a family and especially that between a child and her adopt parent it be a pretty honest and open look at feeling that can be extremely touching and heartwarme at some time and quite painful at other it be an emotionally complex film with character that be somewhat idealise but still behave in a very human waybr br The film revolve around 9 year old Amudha play with charm and vivaciousness by young actress PS Keerthana in her first and only acting role she be a princess and a monster always get into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at she for long the young actress be perfectly cast for the role and do a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scene require of herbr br a peck on the CHEEK have such an innocent name I be quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience never have such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact I dare say the film be a bold and artistic effort to explore issue that be not frequently cover on the silver screenbr br Mani Ratman s direction be superb very confident and mature the most sophisticated work I have see from this director yet the film be visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork and imagery AR Rahman provide the film s soundtrack which be not as good as his classic dil SE or BOMBAY music base on first impression at least but still show his great musical talentbr br Im not aware of a dvd release for the film yet I see it in Tamil with english subtitle thank to the San Francisco International Film Festival of which the film be undoubtedly the highlight the production be a truly world class effort and I be sure it will be popular with western audience as it begin to receive wide exposurebr br recommende,"[[18, 17, 8], [11,

I know enough about the director filmography to know that it primarily consist of outright schlock Nurse Sherri be really not all that bad sure it be clear that this be very low budget stuff yet all that I find egregiously cheesy about it be the visual effect the acting be not as bad as one might expect eitherbr br There be two different version available of this on DVD a much more sex orient version feature bountiful amount of T A be the original cut with such hilariously silly vignette as the victim and and her love interest share their strange sex moment include one involve fellatio during a college lecturebr br The movie would then be re cut for theatrical version with the horror element emphasize more strongly some scene be drop with new one add with Stevens the role play by JC Wells expand the movie most memorable sequence in this cut be a scene in a foundry and it work quite well this cut of the movie be more interesting overall I would recommend that a viewer see they both and compare thembr br Both version hit their stride in the final third and benefit from a marvelously scene steal performance from Bill Roy as the craze Reanhauer and a moody climax set in a graveyard although actually film in Adamsons backyard Marilyn Joi be also worth mention as the cute nurse who be attract to football player turn patient Marcus Washington Prentiss Moulden who be lose

274,I love just about everything the late Al Adamson direct in his long and varied career but the Possession of Nurse Sherri stand head and shoulder above fun yet admittedly grade z schlockfest like Horror of the Blood Monsters and Dracula Vs Frankenstein this film be actually scary be I say that you be go to jump out of your seat when you watch Nurse Sherri no of course not but this pastiche of element from the exorcist Ruby and Carrie be one of those nice eerie little horror movie common to the seventy you can not put your finger on what be so spooky about it but the film drip with atmosphere and what an ending do not worry I will not spoil it for you Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nail it with this one and it do not matter whether Nurse Sherri be a calculate success or a happy accident Jill Jacobson be likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possess by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader Bill Roy who shine in his brief role Geoffrey Land be okay as her surly doctor boyfriend there be some blaxploitative element here profit be the bottom line with these cheap drive in flick after all but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just be window dressing Nurse Sherri be a Poverty row production and it show at time set special effect etc still the film have heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chill Sam Sherman also see fit to use Harry Lubin s theme music for the late 50 early 60 television series one step Beyond in this film which certainly add to the creepy atmosphere the dvd contain two significantly different cut of the movie the early version feature a lot of TA that wound up on the cut room floor to make way for more horrific stuff as well as the theatrical trailer the tv spot and a great commentary by Sherman do anybody know whatever happen to Bill Roy by the way next to John Carradine he be the good actor I have ever see in an Al Adamson film and he play the cult leader like he mean it,"[[8], [11, 14, 21, 4], [9, 20, 18, 19], [0, 1, 14, 20, 19], [4, 21, 4, 17, 24, 19, 7, 8, 13, 6], [19, 7, 4], [11, 0, 19, 4], [0, 11], [0, 3, 0, 12, 18, 14, 13], [3, 8, 17, 4, 2, 19], [8,

have so much unintentional entertainment value first off this start by rip off the end theme music from Outer Limits so you know thing be look promise this be the story of some wacko cult that live in the hill and while try to raise a dead body the leader suffer a heart attack and end up in the hospital of course Nurse Sherri tend to his need and all and when an operation be need she just happen to be hang out in the operating room when the guy pass on so his spirit invade she and Nurse Sherri begin to change no long the nice nurse she develop a taste for blood and sharp object there be a couple little side story go on like folk try to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that have become the love object of one of Sherri s co worker who also just happen to dabble in voodoo this be not bad if you be a cult film fan but it may be bad if you be a Spiderman fan because you will not like it at time this actually lurch towards respectability for Adamson anyway but then it unredeem itself with some ridiculous event if you enjoy Adamson s film and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be look for a lost treasure keep dig 7 out of 10,"[[22,

282,this comment will probably have spoiler I check the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoiler but be AWARE ANYWAYS if I say something that you might consider a SPOILER and I dont wow good game since Super Mario 64 I get this game the first day it come out and before I get it I go on some game website to look at its rating yes they already review it before it come out and I be shocked I be expect something like Sunshine because lately all the Mario game have kind of be get bad and bad but this one totally beat the other game the score on this game even beat Halo 3 it be simply amazingbr br story not the good Mario game be never know for their plot and this one be not really much of a difference Bowser once again kidnap Peach but this time invade the Mushroom Kingdom on a festival celebrate once every century and get a fly saucer and it shoot laser on the ground and then they put anchor inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer spacebr br graphics absolutely gorgeous the good graphic on Wii so far the water effect be really nice too if you ever see the water it look so real because the effect they put in itbr br music simply amazing the music in this game be orchestrate not all of it but even the one that be not orchestrate still sound very nicebr br gameplay very entertaining keep you want to play more and more and for I since usually I tend to be very frustrated with game if I die a lot I mean I be definitely not the only one but this game for I do not have that a lot now it still kind of do but not to the point like Mario 64 where I totally go crazy and end up turn off the game because it make I mad this one never do thatbr br difficulty there be two type of difficulty because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 star which I think be kind of easy but to beat the game 100 you have to get 120 like always and that quest be way hard but at the same time still very funbr br LENGTH good length definitely not too short it take I around 15 16 hour to beat it with just 60 star but 120 take I more like 45 50 hour now I do not play it constantly that much I play first a lot one day then the next couple of day just a couple hour each day then the next two day I play it all day to I though I think the quest for 60 star be a tiny bit short so if you want a long game I suggest get all of thembr br presentation now the cinematic scene in this movie be superb the way they be it just look so much like something I would see in the theater they be hand down the good cinematic scene on any Mario game so farbr br overall this game be definitely a great game and I advise you to not wait until Christmas get it as soon as possible this game also be a good mixture of old and new you will have some sidescroll level where you move just side to side or up and down because they will change on gravity but even the music have some old classic in it so this game seem to be like a masterpiece to I it be my favorite Mario game of all time but other may disagree but it be still a great game I recommend every gamer who want to have fun in a game to get this,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [2, 14, 12, 12, 4, 13,

283,I have be a Mario fan for as long as I can remember I have very fond memory of play Super Mario World as a kid this game have bring back many of those memory while add something new Super Mario Galaxy be the late installment in the amazing Mario franchise there be much very different about this game from any other Mario before it while still keep intact the great element of Mario the first noticeable difference be that the story take place in spacebr br The story begin much like any other Mario game Mario receive a letter from Princess Peach invite he to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom upon arrive at Peach s castle Mario find Bowser and his son Bowser Jr attack the castle with their airship Bowser kidnap Princess Peach and then lift her castle up into space in the midst of the castle be lift into space Mario fall off and land on an unknown planet Mario be find by a talk star name Luma and be take back to the Luma s home a float space station here Mario meet many other Lumas and also meet their leader a woman name Rosalina Rosalina tell Mario that Bowser have take away the space station s Power Stars and scatter they across the universe it be up to Mario to help the Lumas find they and save Peach thus the adventure beginsbr br The way you play the game be by fly from the space station to other galaxy each galaxy consist of multiple planet that Mario travel amongst in level via these shoot star to retrieve the Power Stars Mario can at many time walk all the way around planet without lose gravity some planet be small and other be big many planet be similar to classic Mario environment the good thing about the game be the control all of the stuff like jumping and such be still the same but the wiimote be use in many unique way in this game you shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that be use as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shoot star you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bit at enemy or object in the environment then there be the graphic these be by far the good graphic on the Wii it be just so hard to describe how great this game look you could probably almost say it look as good as some 360 gamesbr br My only minor gripe be that the go upside down effect take some getting use to and also the story be pretty weak the bad part be that you lose all of your life when you turn off the game no matter how many you have when you last quit you restart at 4 life still these minor problem aside it be a superb game that be highly entertaining and be very challenging this be the type of game that we have be wait for on the wiibr br a perfect 10 out of 10,"[[8], [7, 0, 21, 4], [1, 4], [0], [12, 0, 17, 8, 14], [5, 0, 13], [5, 14, 17], [0, 18], [11, 14,

286,one of Chaplin s long film up to that point Burlesque on Carmen be a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what be then Prosper Merimee s well know story about Carmen I be a little confused about the difference between the IMDb s listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version base on the running time I assume that it be the 1915 version that I see since the 1916 one be a good 20 minute long and from what I have read those be 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minute br br From the very beginning it be clear that Burlesque on Carmen be one of Chaplin s most complex and ambitious effort to date start off with a long back story tell through inter title about the tragic love story of Carmen br br Carmen be send by a band of gypsy a band who put the GYP in gypsy to seduce a spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation it be a clever chaplinesque band of criminal the leader of whom Lillas Pastia have spend 50 year learn to steal think he might be offer a job in politic br br On a side note I have see some almost misogynistic message and joke in some of Chaplin s early work but probably none quite as overt as in this one near the beginning of the movie as the band of gypsy be travel there be a scene where the mule and woman be load and an inter title explain that the mule be the one with long ear in case you could not tell I guess br br Chaplin play the part of Don Jose the hapless officer who be to be seduce by Carmen he be describe as a brave soldier and lover of woman not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who remove any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few year later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms and of course he do not have to act about be a lover of womenbr br What be different here of course be his polished military uniform and straight back disciplinary manner intersperse of course with some of his traditional slap stick move he strike I as a little guy in a position of authority struggle to maintain the respect of his subordinate by exert a gruff stolid exteriorbr br Soon Carmen enter love by all man under the age of 96 and she immediately begin flirt with Charlie I should mention that for a good majority of the movie it be surprisingly faithful to the original story which be full of jealousy and tragedy Chaplin be strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that I have never see from he there be at least one scene where he be genuinely a little scary br br Chaplin have some great sight gag in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fight near the end and his boyish charm and the role of a soldier be also definitely a win combination although there be another peculiar stunt involve a group of man push a huge door back and forth that be not very effective to begin with but just keep go on and on and on probably about five time long than it be worth although it be interesting that when it finally fall over it clearly be reveal as a movie prop I always appreciate such glimpse at the old movie setsbr br The end of the film be it be strong part it bear strike resemblance to Romeo and Juliet but just when you think that Chaplin be go to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverge distantly from his traditional style there be a hilarious twist that be as vintage Chaplin as anything I have ever see nice work,"[[14, 13, 4], [14, 5], [2, 7, 0, 15, 11, 8, 13], [18], [11, 14, 13, 6], [5, 8, 11, 12], [20, 15], [19, 14], [19, 7, 0, 19], [15, 14, 8, 13, 19], [1, 20, 17, 11, 4, 18, 16, 20, 4], [14, 13], [2,

287,be the second last of Chaplin s Essanay film CARMEN be a parody of Cecil B Demille s drama with the same title it stand as quite obvious that Demille s acknowledge film do not impress the comedy king that much which he later admit in his autobiographybr br parodie be not a new experiment for Chaplin he have do several of they already namely his prehistoric past and his new job and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in film for instance in a king in NEW YORKbr br Chaplin do a very good portrayal of Don Jos and Edna Purviance s be very as good as Carmen neither act as we be use to Charlie be not the lovable Tramp and Edna be far from an innocent little woman but that be not Chaplin s intention either a BURLESQUE ON CARMEN be a somewhat odd Chaplin film very different but include good material nonethelessbr br The main story be although very differently structure as in the original drama Don Jos be very much in love with Carmen but be not alone in that field Carmen Carmen the beautiful Carmen be love by all man under 96 but he have the big advantage that he be an officer and there we be this be the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor see from a humorous perspective thank to Chaplin s and Purviance s performance and to the wonderful wonderful music by George Bizet which I highly admire this could actually have be a near comedy masterpiece it be time take into consideration it could have be but unfortunately although it be a good pretty good comedy I do not feel it be fair to blame people who claim that a BURLESQUE of CARMEN be far from be a masterpiece but it be important to keep in mind that this have nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflict concern business when Chaplin refuse to re sign Essanay contract after complete his last film for the company POLICE they take revenge by edit back all the scene Chaplin originally have edit out from CARMEN thank to this the film be somewhat confusing and have several pointless scene which be more annoying than funny and the film turn out to be rather a Ben Turpin feature Turpin play Remendados than a Chaplin short naturally Chaplin be in despair when he discover what Essanay have do and have to stay in bed for several daysbr br Despite its obvious flaw a BURLESQUE of CARMEN be highly recommend to Chaplin fan and to admirer of beautiful music,"[[1, 4], [19, 7, 4], [18, 4, 2, 14, 13, 3], [11, 0, 18, 19], [14, 5], [2, 7, 0, 15, 11, 8, 13], [18], [4, 18, 18, 0, 13, 0, 24], [5, 8, 11, 12], [2, 0, 17, 12, 4, 13], [1, 4], [0],

298,I be lucky enough for this film to come on TCM so I have the opportunity to see it it be rather hard to find despite it be a Hitchcock classic unfortunately it also have its shortcoming some of which Hitchcock have repeat later first off the ending be a little too neat and perfect in the last few scene until the last five minute there be an astounding amount of tension then the five minute just clear everything perfectly up very unsatisfying the ending be also overly dramatic for a Hitchcock film he be be and always will be the master of suspense why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending apart from the few shortcoming the film be great the plot be excellent one of the good and most universal ever the theme simple you meet a stranger a perfect stranger he offer to kill someone for you you know you have someone you wantif nothing else subconsciously dead the catch he ask you to do the same for he will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement you be clear of suspicion and so be he after all neither of you know the victim and you do not know each other either you be just stranger on a train brilliant concept and one that just about every single person can relate to the pacing be good you never lose interest or patience the cinematography be good but not nearly as good as it be in other well Hitchcock film the acting be flawless the character be well write credible and realistic Hitchcock use some of the same element that he often use the dominate mother the mother boy etc the film be very good but it just feel a little water down it do not go that famous extra mile that would have make it great it stop before cross the line between what be common and what be dare that be the primary reason for the film fail to be great but mainly remain good with potential to be more than that the end leave you unsatisfied and disappointed however everything lead up to the end be very good so the film still get a deserve 810 good but not great any fan of Hitchcock should see it as it be among his good somewhat far down on the list but still there I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock 810,"[[8], [1, 4], [11, 20, 2,

302,as I look at this movie once again I think it belong among Hitchcock s great film the first time I see it I be just blow away by the suspense action and imagery it have the gripping ending the deranged murderer the innocent man frame or victimize by circumstance some great on location shot eg the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York it also have great support actor with Hitch s daughter Patricia in the role of the young sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movie the merry go round episode near the end be one of the most nerve wracking in Hitchcock s body of workbr br Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony his last full film give a great performance as the derange stranger on the train who worm himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haines Farley Granger Granger play the nice guy who be catch up in a messy divorce the movie open with the camera show the shoe of two separate man as they leave their taxi to board the train eventually they meet and the story take over the stranger take an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continue the stranger become a stalker the action shift from place to place include Washington the fictional small town of Metcalf the Forest Hills tennis championship and a passenger train take the two lead man back and forth on separate mission towards the end the pace of a tennis game be weave into the plot as they race against time the camera cut away to the face of the athlete as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shot when the closely fight contest be over the climactic chase take place Hitchcock have a love for train and it be great to see Penn Station long since go train be feature in the 39 Steps the Lady Vanishes Shadow of a Doubt Spellbound North by Northwest and this movie br br this classic Hitchcock thriller take place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense the 1950 s and I be convinced that one day it will be give its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame,"[[0, 18], [8], [11, 14, 14, 10], [0, 19], [19, 7, 8, 18], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [14, 13, 2, 4], [0, 6, 0, 8, 13], [8], [19,

303,one of Alfred Hitchcock s three great film along with psycho and the 39 step stranger on A train be as brilliantly out of control as a merry go round in Metcalf and almost as deadly it be the kind of film you have so much fun watching you can not even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breathbr br Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines Farley Granger meet a singularly weird louche stranger name Bruno Anthony Robert Walker on a train thank to the gossip page Bruno know all about Guy s problem with his no good wife Miriam and rather gaily suggest they do each other a favor Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno s father who want to put Bruno in an institution guy laugh it off but Bruno be not kid as Guy find out to his perilbr br It be a great premise for a murder story and Hitchcock give Strangers on A train a run for all its worth with the help of Walker in perhaps the great performance in any Hitchcock film include Anthony Perkins in psycho while perkin make his mark play tetchily against the grain Walker as Anthony be one perfectly at home either butter up old lady at a swank dinner party or strangle a young woman at an amusement parkbr br What drive Bruno many commentator suggest his apparent homosexuality find a match in pretty Guy yes Bruno light up the old gay dar but Guy seem happy enough on love s rebound with socialite Anne Morton Ruth Roman Bruno s interest for Guy could just as easily be envy for someone make a mark in the world while he live at home let Mommy file his nailsbr br oh I certainly admire people who do thing Bruno purr look like a cat eye a mouse you know it must be pretty exciting to be so important br br later on Bruno call himself a bum accurate enough except for our root interest in he even as he wreck Guy s life with his homicidal meddling it be the ultimate perverse underdog s tale there be a sense of integrity about Bruno in his dog dedication which command our respect and which Hitchcock play to so brilliantly when Bruno float away from the scene of his big crime be I the only sick person in this world who be actually happy for he I think not yet Hitchcock keep the story on a right enough path for we to realize how low we have fall we do not want Bruno to win exactly but we enjoy his lan as he triesbr br everythe else be so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable Hitchcock always manage at least 2 3 good setpiece sequence per movie here you get a score of they at the amusement park alone 20 big show the neon side at the entrance say and they be not kid Script camera work a grip tennis match Ruth Roman s jaw dropping figure it be all too much greatness for one film to contain even Granger do his callow youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managedbr br You can call this a clinic in movie making but clinic sound too dull stranger on A train be good nasty fun all the way through leave you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you be root for the wrong stranger all along heck I will take that ride over again in a second,"[[14, 13, 4], [14, 5], [0, 11, 5, 17, 4, 3], [7, 8, 19, 2, 7, 2, 14,

305,when Alfred Hitchcock make stranger on a train it be a harbinger for the bulk of the film go public that he be back at the top of his form from 1946 to 1950 his film be not box office success and his contractual arrangement with David O Selznick end because of this actually he make some really good film in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND under CAPRICORN ROPE and my opinion STAGESTRUCK but while NOTORIOUS and SPELLBOUND be like the audience be turn off by Hitch s attempt at experimentation his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND be acceptable as be the setting among psychiatrist but the experiment with long take in ROPE confuse the public make ignore the merit of that film and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fool by a lie tell by a lead character in a flashback be dislike far more disliked then it deserve to be in STAGESTRUCK a matter of bad timing for under CAPRICORN it be release just as the scandal of it be star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini break out make it seem to be a failure which it be not the paradine case be another failure and one that really have little in it be favorbr br With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shy away from the special trick that interest he in the recent film instead he concentrate on his favorite theme of share guilt and mistaken identity base on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story be of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meet a fan of his Bruno Anthony a playboy who be travel on a cross country train at the same time as the athlete Bruno be talkative and fawn and Guy view he as one of the typical fan he have meet if a little eccentric with his talk of want to be on the first rocket to outer space but Bruno know all about Guy s personal problem he be married to a promiscuous young woman name Miriam and be in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator Bruno know that Miriam will not divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mention how he can sympathize he hate his stepfather who be constantly criticize he then Bruno mention sort of off the cuff an idea he have about two man technically stranger exchange murder for each other and then commit two perfect unsolvable crime instead of fumble they guy listen to the idea and agree it be an interesting idea the train reach Guy s destination and his last comment be like a validation of the idea he just do not realize that the eccentric Bruno be a sociopath and believe Guy have just agree to the two kill each other s foebr br It be a wonderfully simple plot actually Bruno of course do kill Miriam but he fully expect Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather Guy be horrify and bad he find that he be the police department s number one suspect when Bruno to encourage Guy mention he have the latter s light he pocket it on the train and can plant it at the murder site Guy find himself in deep problem how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane Brunobr br Hitch always plan the shot of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our hero from their foot head towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other there be constant cross contact use in the film to show how the two man be draw into each other s orbit it be like fate draw they together yet both have their own personality and Hitch with a typical twist make the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure his scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what but he have a zest for life one suspect that once Guy too have one but his marriage s failure couple with his now date a socially prominent woman have make he more circumspect and dull than he wasbr br The cast be good too Robert Walker probably have his fine role in this film only a year before his death it be a far cry from the homespun boy next door of since you go away or the CLOCK his lithe figure also look quite elegant in tale in several scene as Guy Farley Granger act like a cousin of his co murderer in ROPE especially as the circumstance make he increasingly suspicious to the authority as his early role make his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart as for the lady Kasie Rogers be properly sluttish as Miriam enable the audience to be prepare for her demise in a famous sequence shoot in the reflection of her eyeglass so that they actually be cheer Bruno in his act of evil Patricia Hitchcock appear as the young sister of Anne Ruth Roman who bear a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally set off Bruno at a social occasion she play this rare role well Ruth Roman be properly supportive of Granger but her role be limit because she be establishment in her background and somewhat low key other support performer Leo G Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne usually a comedian as Bruno s dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker be all show to good advantage all at the hand of a master,"[[22, 7, 4, 13], [0, 11, 5, 17, 4, 3], [7, 8, 19, 2, 7, 2, 14, 2, 10], [12, 0, 10, 4], [18, 19, 17, 0, 13, 6, 4, 17], [14, 13], [0], [19, 17, 0, 8,

idea of carry out two murder the rather pushy Anthony suggest that he could murder Haines unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthony s domineering father the lack of any connection between the

309,this be one of Alfred Hitchcock s good film and one of his most underrated I believe it certainly exceed a psycho or the bird for technical artistry and brilliance it be a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some timebr br Robert Walker create one of Hitchcock s most memorable villain as the father hating mother fixate but be not most of Hitchcock s villain mummy s boy Bruno it be a disturbing stunning performance that illuminate the whole film his character be obsessive apparently homosexual look at those deliberately effeminate tie and hear how he be describe as european strangely charming and dangerous to cross Farley Granger certainly know this as he become entangle in Bruno s sordid web after the pair meet on a train Bruno know some inside information on Guy s affair propose the two swap murder for each other s benefit Walker will kill Granger s slutty connive wife who be inhibit his marriage to beautiful Anne whilst Granger will murder Bruno s father who he so intensely hate everyone s happy right a win win as Bruno assert wrong Granger forget about the indecent proposal but an obsessed Walker do not he commit his murder and be determined to hound Granger until he complete his side of the bargain too stranger become a riveting suspenseful game of cat and mouse in Hitch s capable handsbr br hitchcock be absolutely amazing at create intriguing minor character and building scene we have the whore Miriam Granger s estranged wife pregnant to another man she lasciviously slurps a phallic ice cream cone whilst openly eat up Bruno with her eye Barbara Morton Anne s sister be a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who come out with the most crude remark you will hear from a bespectacled girl in the picture in the 50 s Senator Morton be authoritative and self absorb this be one of the most daring film Hitchcock ever make and it be typical to a Hitch film subtly sexual in detailbr br this fit into the film noir category with it be focus on murder lie and deceit and shadowy cinematography Walker s nut be one for the age and Granger make a convincing troubled protagonist roman be perhaps weak than the other two and I never believe her relationship with Granger still the overwhelming positive cancel out the slight negative and it can be safely say that this be one of the BEST american film ever madebr br just look at what Hitch do here the originality the technical skill we see the murder of Miriam reflect in her shattered glass a game of tennis turn into one of the most thrilling intense scene you will ever see a innocent fairground turn into a place of murder and foul occurrence a young boy s balloon be pop callously by Walker Hitch obviously like what he see in the Third ManChildren

premise be to die for it be slick ooze sophistication and devilish charm the cross cutting between Walker and Granger s character be magnificent Granger s do or die tennis match be just as vital as villain Walker s rescue of an incriminate piece of evidence lose down a drain Hitch again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming do anyone else find he strangely attractive more so than Granger piece of work we be just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the light out of the drain we need he to anyway he hold the key to the storybr br Youll never

311,well this be about as good as they come there be argument about whether Hitchcock be only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician or be he really deep nobody know precisely what term like that mean but it be legitimate to ask if at his good he could not have be all three thing at oncebr br In this one he seem to be about at his peak hardly anything in it be accidental it abound with doubt ambiguity and wit and the story be engross Patricia Highsmith apparently have complex similar to Hitchcock s ownbr br Im sure the plot have be thoroughly outline elsewhere so I will not bother go into it I will just point out five on screen incident that Hitchcock be undoubtedly responsible forbr br Bruno Antony Walker have follow Miriam Laura Miller and her two boyfriend to a carnival at night with the intent of murder she she be notice his attention and be innocently flatter by itbr br 1 Laura and her two friend rent an electric boat to go through the Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake Walker be right behind they smile in his boat Pluto Pluto it be not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character it be a reference to Pluto also call Hades a god of the underworld in Greek and roman mythology this tiny touch can not be an accident and the underworld that Walker represent be not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind I hate to say he be a jungian shadow but that be what he be do Carl Jung see this movie he be alive at the time of its release but probably not 2 now this be a deadly serious sequence right Walker be a lunatic who be about to murder a woman he do not even know imagine the way this would have be lay out by most director a night time stalk through a crowded carnival steal from shadow to shadow the killer peer from behind the canvas wall and so forth what do Hitchcock show we when Walker first come through the gate concentrate on his victim a little boy in a cowboy suit hold a balloon run up and shout Bang Bang you be dead Walker jerk his head back in surprise and glare down indignantly at the kid and when the kid start to walk away Walker dart his cigarette at the balloon and pop it then continue his pursuit without another glance that be one way Hitchcock treat impend doombr br 3 the famous strangling reflect in the fall eyeglass which have be ape innumerable timesbr br 4 Miriam and her friend stop at one of those device that you pound with a big mallet send a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow one of her boyfriend wham it and the puck do not reach the bell at the top under Miriam s delighted and admire gaze Walker smile and rub his hand together then pick up the mallet slam it down and the puck bang against the bell she be thrilled he put the mallet down look at she grin and waggles his eyebrow at she like a ten year old showoff 5 after the discovery of Miriam s body while whistle blow and people shout Walker leave the carnival and encounter a blind man wait at the curb Walker take the old fellow by the arm and lead he across the intersection gravely hold up his hand to stop the traffic a macabre jokebr br these incident and other all take place during the ten or fifteen minute of the carnival visit Robert Walker s performance be exceptional throughout it be essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish cf ride the pink horse but the menace of the scene be undercut by Hitchcock s insistence on irony and distance none of the familiar noir technique be employ there be nothing really creepy about it and the murder itself be hardly a savage one I do not think that any director other than Hitchcock would have handle it the way he do it would have be all menace and shadow hiding place abortive attempt scowl instead of grinsbr br Not that it be an entirely flawless movie a flawless movie be not yet with we some of the middle section be a bit slow go and Farley Granger although a nice guy be stolid dull and rather stupid his new girl friend be just dullbr br hitchcock be to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in the Wrong Man I be not sure Hitchcock ever think about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt the latter be impose on he at an early age by his catholic education original sin you be bear with it and all that in film interview he always glibly explain away his fear of the police and of authority generally by tell a story about his father take he to the police station to put a scare into he after some peccadillo we be justify

312,look back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock it never fail to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be deny sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he be for the film industry it be likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock be always attempt to push the envelope and never coast along with a film make simply for the purpose of be entertaining but always with a deep more poignant motive on his mind stranger on a train one of Hitchcock s first and more underrated hit be a perfect example of these trait an entertaining and suspenseful story even when view over 50 year later yes but so carefully and intelligently construct it stand today as a masterpiece in film technique br br arguably one of the pioneer suspense thriller stranger on a train may come across as slightly date in certain aspect but it retain every bit of superbly craft tension as it do back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking the brilliant use of cinematography and light as well as quick careful editing be what really make the film stand out draw out every possible iota of tension and retain the audience s focus even in slow scene if there be ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock be simply watch five minute of Strangers on a train should be enough to disavow such sentiment every shot be so carefully choose and construct all serve to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion sadly enough there be certain moment in the story which be screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing Bruno be able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate be simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawl under a wildly out of control carousel provide unintentional comedic relief in what be mean to be the film s most tense and engaging scene these be only brief moment but they be enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar filmbr br but what really make Strangers on a train stand out be the story premise as Hollywood film of late run the risk of descend inescapably far and far into the vat of turgid cliche after cliche it be wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually come across as smart and original sure it be fairly straightforward but the concept of swap murder be simply one that would not fly in film of today s day and age which make it all the more entertaining to watch the film s brilliant screenplay keep the action flow at a swift pace while provide we with some wonderfully memorable line all the while one can not help but notice the deep theme Hitchcock be allude to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanity s heart demonstrate by elderly lady be fascinate and exhilarate by the prospect of murder as well as Bruno s own cavalier attitude towards death Hitch also work in many moment of dark humour bruno pop a child s balloon with his cigarette be priceless and irony shoot suspenseful scene in happy easy go environment such as the iconic carnival scene to create an even more eerie atmosphere this may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain conceal beneath it would be simply inexcusable br br The antagonistic figure of Bruno essay to perverse perfection by Robert Walker sadly in his last film role but easily steal the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast member be without a doubt what make stranger on a train so memorable as the character be a marvel to behold here we have a simply superbly craft villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seem rather than cackle madly and thwart the hero at every possible moment Bruno be a calm control psychotic mess he speak of murder in such an offhand tone yet retain a passionate glint in his eye when discuss different fashion of kill people Bruno could seem to represent the I d as Freud would put it the inner dark and uninhibited aspect of mankind it make an interesting contrast to the hero figure Guy Haines and how bland and uninteresting he seem almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil be much more interesting and appealing than constantly strive to do the right thing br br Yet despite this imply message Hitch still twist our emotion enough that we root for Guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he be force to overcome it be a testament to actor Farley Granger s talent that despite Robert Walker s villain easily steal the show Granger s hero still come across as sympathetic still command our support even when fall prey to be a far less compelling character superb support be give by Ruth Roman who manage to overcome the cliche and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure Kasey Rogers give a stunning performance as Guy s horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock prove that she be far more talented than be simply the director s daughter would imply the superb cast head by a simply wonderful Walker really bring the film to life add so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock s breathtaking stylistic br br All in all Strangers on a train may still come across as slightly too date for certain viewer but it be still a shock how modern and appeal to contemporary audience seem consider it be release half a century ago once again Hitchcock prove his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the film s surprisingly original and enjoyable premise be alone worth a viewing highly recommend to anyone wish to undertake a brilliantly make but superbly entertain film experience br br 910,"[[11, 14, 14, 10], [1, 0, 2, 10], [0, 19], [19, 7, 4], [2, 0, 17, 4, 4, 17], [14, 5], [0, 11, 5, 17, 4,

313,I have use this movie in my college Ethics course for over 10 year also Woody Allen s Crimes and Misdemeanorsanother terrific multi leveled ethical study br br It s fiction I do not focus too much on the unrealistic feature of Strangers because all fictional film be obviously false on many level I love the film as gallow comedy tautly tell with many ironic twist and visual pleasure even if it be unbelievable the story be tell so well that I do not even think of criticize its plausibility although I must confess that the tennis match seem the weak part to I too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competitionbr br some problem present in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussionbr br 1 Ethical Passivity some weakness of the Guy character be intend by Hitchcock a primary ethical insight of the film be the danger of inability to articulate one s moral position Guy be unable to effectively block Bruno s crazy proposal at the start an interesting question be why and how do Guy behave so passively ineffectively a possible answer be his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process br br 2 miscommunication Guy commit another failure at the start on the train to get away quickly he agree that Bruno s idea be all good but Guy s literal meaning be opposite to his inflected sarcastic meaning Bruno take the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss cross murder Guy take the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement to some extent near the beginning Bruno may be partially pretend that an agreement have be strike to draw Guy far into a web of complicity Bruno be manipulate Guy Guy s linguistic ambiguity on the train give Bruno a chance to put an ethical stranglehold on Guy Bruno manipulate Guy may also take on other meaning br br 3 secrecy some have speculate about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno it seem at first ridiculous especially since Guy appear obviously heterosexual in his relationship with Miriam and Anne however remember that Guy be also ineffective with both woman Guy appear stereotypically it be 1951 remember effeminate especially in relationship to Bruno Guy the strong athlete be weak on the inside Bruno be also conflict play against himself appear facially and physically strong at first but then display some effeminate trait Bruno s fashion and footwork his gush emotionally to Guy in different situation his receive a manicure from his dote mother Bruno kissing and desperately fondle his mother s hand other more subtle gay stereotype that hold cryptic meaning from Hitchcock s point of view I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify his intend meaning herebr br 4 Dishonesty and Distrust Guy make some colossal blunder in hiding truth about Bruno from family and from police guy fail to fully comprehend that admit fault quickly may be well than a cover up or a delay in confession again Guy be drive by passivity insecurity fear and perhaps a self hate that be close to Bruno s own self loathing than we care to see or to admit both Guy and Bruno act out their own parable of impotencebr br 5 lack of evidence Guy feel a problem muster the evidence to acquit himself while quickly go to the police would solve a huge problem Guy trap himself with his own doubt and insecurity the absence of desire alibi the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on Guy s behalf the obsessive need to appear politically pristine and other personality factor that cause Guy to feel defenseless he be as dysfunctional as Bruno just not as dangerous yet one could partially blame Guy for Miriam s murderbr br 6 Disease and Mental Disorder an interesting question be how legally responsible be Bruno for the murder the more ethically incompetent Bruno be as a sick sociopath the more guilty Guy may be as someone healthy who fail to stand up and morally act to prevent the crime Guy s failure be like a man who fail to call the police when a sick friend threaten suicide and death ensue one could argue that more than one crime be commit and that Guy be an emotionally hobble accomplicebr br these and many other feature of the film make stranger on a train a gem of a morality play a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflection,"[[8], [7, 0, 21, 4], [20, 18, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [8, 13], [12, 24], [2, 14,

314,this be such a revered and study film a classic among Hitchcock s many it take no cajoling to want to watch it again yet you think can it hold up even when the huge and clever and amazing trick of the plot be no surprisebr br Yesbr br And for starter there be the start a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story the gist of it two taxi two man show with their shoe each walk onto the train sit then across from each other and oop a mistake a little nudge and the conversation begin and we see the man themselves they be interchangeable br br The tone here be characteristic of Hitchcock as it be in many horror and suspense films cheery and light we know enter the film however that this will not be the case so already we be worried what after all be about to go wrongbr br a lot in truly hitchcock fashion it be a purely innocent man nearly always a man who face injustice who be trap by circumstance threaten what be most valuable to he the innocent in this case tennis player Guy Haynes be play with an innocence that be believable his collegiate politeness in that first scene for example as he realize the other man be a little cuckoo be just what you or I might do the not so innocent man be the self absorb and scarily intelligent spoiled child Bruno Anthony play with utter brilliance by Robert Walker this uncanny performance be equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko play by Anthony Perkins in Psycho so from scene one on the train and the train really gorgeous we have the two lead and we have the mind blow and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith who also write the book behind the two Mr Ripley movie and it do not hurt that the screenplay be co write by Raymond Chandler himself who know something about economy and clever dialog and crimebr br And of course there be more than just the first scene what to note well that smarty of a senator s daughter I think she be terrific be Hitchcock s daughter Patricia who be still with we as of 2009 she also have a role in psycho and there be a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film the tennis court in the Hamptons know to we as the site of the US Open the fantastic last full scene with the carousel be the only place where Hitchcock move into a kind of slow and steady montage build up the suspense by make it surreal the fear get positively fatten with the laugh child and the old man crawl underneath it all and when it collapse in a crash that be all backprojecte on a set one of the more naturalistic use by a director know for not worry about the realism of his back projectionsbr br The photography be that perfect Hollywood stunning without become so stylize as in some noir film that it be an object in its own right look again at the first scene or the shooting and editing of Haynes enter the house for what the audience think be a murder this be sophisticated construction when we be not completely surprised that it be Bruno in the bed that only prove that the director have we on our toe something unexpected be always expectedbr br Are there glitch who know it depend on what kind of falseness you can accept or embrace as beautiful style the scene where Bruno be choke the old woman at a party be both brilliant the woman play by Norma Varden be a caricature so believable it take your breath away and mar by his look at the senator s daughter and be trigger into a deadly trance by her glass and her resemblance to his early victim this be a mid20th Century idea of psychology that intrude on many of Hitchcock s effort the end of Psycho for startersbr br The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasize the consistent doubling of thing in the movie from the main character to the murder victim and the senator s daughter this echo in lot of little way two man trail he to the tennis court two man accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on there can be too much make of this but it do supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness do not forget there be mean to be two murder it be the lack of the second murder the inability to create a doubling in that case that cause Bruno to unravelbr br Walker the actor have emotional problem and be institutionalize in the year before this movie be shoot and just afterwards he die from a reaction to a drug use to calm one of his outburst though he appear in other film Strangers on a train be easily his tour de force Farley Granger have a long career that never quite see he break into true stardom though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really work especially in they live by Night br br And if you watch this one for the first or third time do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd s head all move back and forth in unison except for Bruno s he be stare out without move his head straight at we as the trailer for the movie say after this movie you will not be talk to stranger on a train,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [18, 20, 2, 7], [0], [17, 4, 21, 4, 17, 4, 3], [0, 13, 3], [18, 19, 20, 3, 24], [5, 8, 11, 12],

317,stranger on a train be one of those film classic I have always hear about but somehow never get around to actually see I finally watch it a few week ago and as always with any Hitchcock movie it not only stand up to the test of time it far surpass most thriller be make today you can see the inspiration for future action movie here the climactic end with the out of control merry go round and the two villain duel each other remind I of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont s speed of course stranger be over forty year old than speed and contain no modern special effect but the visceral thrill be there Hitchcock be a true geniusbr br The not so subtle gay side of Bruno Robert Walker in an amazing performance have take form in many other psycho stalker figure in future movie consider he a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female he know about Guy before he even meet he on the train we almost get the feeling their contact be not incidental and be soon entirely obsess with himbr br Hitchcock love the oedipial element in his movie also see psycho for more blatant undertone and there be a lot of that here Bruno hate his father and want he to die so he can be with his mother his effeminate way and obvious homosexuality must have just slip by the censor in 1951 when gay be not allow to be portray on the screen yet Hitchcock get the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wear a very non masculine robe flirt with Guy and respond to his motherbr br The deep layer of this movie make it a fast pace thriller than you can return to again and again unfortunately it be be remade as a big budget Hollywood production but after see the original I honestly can not imagine anything surpass the sheer white knuckle thrill of this movie,"[[18, 19, 17, 0, 13, 6, 4, 17], [14, 13], [0], [19, 17, 0, 8, 13], [1, 4], [14, 13, 4], [14, 5], [19, 7, 14, 18, 4], [5, 8, 11, 12], [2, 11, 0, 18, 18, 8, 2], [8], [7, 0, 21, 4],

319,Alfred Hitchcock have make many brilliant thriller and many of they have go on to be hail as some of the great film of all time one film that tend to get somewhat lose under the Vertigo s and the psycho s be this film stranger on a train the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever make the story follow Guy Haines a tennis player and a man soon to be we d to the Senator s daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife one day on the way to see his wife he meet the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon get draw into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall and one that could ultimately cost he his lifebr br The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy be one of the cinema s most intriguing and think provoking of all time what if two people swap murder thus resolve themselves of all suspicion of the crime and render their motive irrelevant could this truly be the perfect murder what make this film all the more frightening be that the event that Guy be lead into could happen to any normal everyday person everyone have someone they would like to get rid of so what if you meet an insane man aboard a train that do your murder for you and then force you to do his the chance of it happen be unlikely but it be the idea that anyone could be a murderer that be central to the message of Strangers on a train and in this situation anyone could br br is there any actor on earth that could have portray the character of Bruno Anthony any well than Robert Walker the man be simply bear for the part he manage to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely command every scene he be in the character of Bruno be a madman but he be not a lunatic he be a calculating connive human being and Robert Walker make the character believable his performance be extremely malevolent and yet understate enough to keep the character firmly within the realm of reality unfortunately Robert Walker die just one year after the release of Strangers on a train and I believe that be a great loss to cinema nobody in the cast shine as much as Walker do but worth mention be his co star Farley Granger Granger never really impress that much but his performance be good enough and he hold his own against Walker also notable about his performance be that he portray his character as a very normal person and that be how it should be Ruth Roman be Guy s wife to be she be not really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she make the good of what she have Alfred Hitchcock s daughter Patricia take the final role of the four central role as Barbara the sister of Guy s fianc she be suitably lovely in this role and she tend to steal a lot of the scene that she be inbr br Alfred Hitchcock s direction be always sublime and it be very much so in this film there be one shot in particular that see the murder of the film be commit in the reflection of a pair of sunglass this be an absolutely brilliant shot and one that create a great atmosphere for the scene Hitchcock s direction be moody throughout and very much complie with the film noir style the climax to the film be both spectacular and exciting and I do not think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pull it off to the great effect that it be show in this film it be truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it work there be a reason that Hitchcock be often cite as the great director of all time and the reason for that be that he do not only use the script to tell the film s story but he also use to camera to do so as well stranger on a train be one of the great thriller ever make its story be both intriguing and think provoking and be sure to delight any fan of cinema a masterpiece,"[[0, 11, 5, 17, 4, 3], [7, 8, 19, 2,

murder there be a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno lose the light with which he intend to frame Guy down a drain the gasp of tension and sigh of relief on the part of the audience I be a part of in support of an insane murderer be inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly reveal about our true reaction to conformity and success and Hitch milk it with callous glee listen to the mock music and exagerrated composition and kick yourself for take it all so seriouslybr br STRANGERS be one of Hitch s five good film and therefore one of the great thing in cinema the dialogue be so strange and brilliant I can not believe it be not write by Chandler Patricia Hitchcock be a wonderful imp stand in for her cheeky father as she taunt Guy the fairground finale be a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set piece black comedy and symbolic site if Bruno s final word condemn he to hell accord to the catholic precept Hitch be suppose to embody compare with a similar ending in the KILLERS we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to Guy s debased serve of self,"[[14, 13, 4], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [7, 0, 21, 4], [4, 23, 15, 4, 2, 19], [7, 8, 19, 2, 7, 2, 14, 2, 10],

326,I enjoy this film which offer a variety of interesting subplot and complex love hate relation along with intersperse action scene and some lighthearted moment in which the mountain man counter harsh army discipline all the main character be well cast true John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have do the star role just as well but Victor Mature certainly come across as a headstrong brawl Tarzan of sort remind I of his film role as Samson another difficult but not impossible man to tamebr br The mountain man in the opening scene be certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain man pretty much end 20 year before with the collapse of western beaver population as well as the fashion market for beaver pelt this story supposedly take place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War judge by the volcano in the background of the opening sceneprobably Mt Lassen the fictional fort be locate somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades as we never see any other civilian however there be plenty of conflict evidence that it actually take place in the mountain of Wyoming or Montana Red Cloud the war chief who threaten the trapper and soldier in the fort be the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who lead a very successful campaign in 1865 66 to exterminate the newly build army fort in Wyoming and Montana Fort Laramieeastern Wyomingis mention as be not too far remove from the fictional fort the plain tribe of Assiniboines be mention as join Red Cloud this aspect of the story then bear a general resemblance to historical factbr br it may be of interest to note certain resemblance between the plot of this story and that of John Ford s Fort Apache in both case we have a fort commander who be recently assign to his first frontier post with native american problem he underestimate the military prowess of his adversary regard they as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career in both film he pay dearly for his inexperience in deal with the enemy also in common the greenhorn commander resent a subordinate who have long experience with the local Native Americans and want to tell he what be wise to do and not to do in both film we have a bud romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commander s heart and a subordinate which the commander do everything to squelch clearly the commander must be eliminate to allow these romance to proceed to completionbr br i also see certain resemblance with the misfit the soldier as a whole include the commander be misfit of a sortas one of they admit mostly they have problem or be raw recruit with no experience fight Native Americans the commander s wife apparently be the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus be inherently a misfit with a husband who be very uncertain of his future in the army the trapper in turn be also misfit not really want to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit live by the recent army generate antagonism by Red Cloud br br finally we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann s later film the Far Country star Jimmy Stewart in Stewart s case he can choose to return to be a loner cowboy at the end but Mature s character do not come up with an appetizing new way of be his own boss red Cloud have make life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate besides he have an obsession with the Commander s wife,"[[8], [4, 13, 9, 14, 24], [19, 7, 8, 18], [5, 8, 11, 12], [22, 7, 8, 2, 7], [14, 5, 5, 4, 17], [0], [21, 0, 17, 8, 4, 19, 24], [14, 5], [8, 13, 19, 4,

329,one of the more obscure of Anthony Mann s Westerns the Last Frontier be also his only cavalry western aside from one brief episode in Winchester 73 though naturally he focus on the outsider and internal conflict rather than offer a fordian celebration of comradeship and share ideal set not in his beloved high country but in the foothill and forest it be a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many way his Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend this outpost be make up of misfit failure coward and the odd competent officer ignore by his superior badly lead while the Civil War take priority and all the good the army have to offerbr br Victor Mature and James Whitmore be the free trapper who find civilisation creep up on they when they be relieve of their pelt and packhorse by a local tribe aggrieve by the incursion of the Cavalry into their territory rather than blame the Indians for their loss they decide it be the army s fault for build the fort and decide to demand compensation from they end up join their rank as scout instead but despite the good effort of Guy Madison s amiable and competent acting commander to bring Mature into the 19th Century and make he fit to wear the uniform the arrival of Robert Preston s humiliate Colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drive he out of his own outpost and Mature s clumsy infatuation with the Colonel s wife Anne Bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who be tired of be save by man who think they know what be good for she soon drive matter into much dark territory it be not long before some of the soldier be busily plan on kill each other both side try to goad their subordinate into do the deed for they little wonder that at one point Mature throw away the bluecoat he have long covet in disgust scream I would have die for this but it be nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag the Stallone of his day Mature be one of those actor who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when match with the right part and the right director this be not one of his well day despite have his most complex part perversely enough as a simple man well meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seem design with Burt Lancaster in mind with some strike similarity to his character in the Kentuckian but Robert Preston s Ahab like Colonel be clearly the good role determine to resurrect the career he destroy in a single disastrously suicidal Civil War engagement by launch another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that add another humiliation to the list that keep he out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board in his obsession to redeem his career he move far away from any hope of moral redemption drive as much by his sense of shame at his wife s sympathy as by the promotion of former comrade he regard as his inferior he be beyond

330,br br The Last Frontier be a superior western that overcome numerous deficiency in weave its tale of trapper Jed Victor Mature Gus James Whitmore and Mongo Pat Hogan and their relationship with the army particularly Captain Riordon Guy Madison Colonel MarstonRobert Preston and Corrina Marston colonel s wife Anne Bancroft hire as scout after lose their supply to the Indians Jed Gus and Mungo adjust to live the civilize life within a fort on the edge of the last frontier Jed who have be raise by Gus both inspire and look up to the old Gus and Mungo and have an especially difficult time deal with civilization his real problem start after he becomes strongly attract to the colonel s wife Corrina Colonel Marstonis a reckless man who endanger every one around he with his dream of ruthless victory over any opponent Corrina a woman repress by her station and sense of responsibility love her husband for what he could be and jed for what he be catch in the middle be Captain Riordon a brave and likeable man tear among his duty to the army his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequence of the colonel s recklessness br br What make this movie so interesting as well as entertaining be that in most case the weakness and the strength of the Last Frontier be exactly the same element forget the insipid title and date musicbr br First the screenplay almost all of the subplot particularly the reckless Colonel have be do well elsewhere but have rarely be assemble with such eccentricity just when you think you know what be go to happen next this one take off in a different direction POSSIBLE SPOILER the Last Frontier be a Production Code movie back in the day the word virgin be taboo it be very surprising that the adultery factor be handle in such a mature tolerant manner I expect either Jed or the colonel s wife to reap some retribution for their sin I be surprised and a little disappointed the movie do not exploit that expectation to create a less predictable endingbr br Second the casting Mature be at least ten year too old to play the part of Jed the wild eyed innocent raise in the wood James Whitmore who play Gus the man who raise Jed be actually five year young than Mature nevertheless Mature be very endearing play a character who be innocent of civilization but be in no way stupid although there be several actor who could have play the role at the time most notably Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas none could have play Jed well Preston also Mature s junior play Colonel Marston miss the tic and affectation one would expect from such a drive man however Preston perfectly capture the sense of honor someone must have see in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel s rank Bancroft be an especially shrewd choice as Corrina Bancroft s dark hair have be die blonde and this achieve the same effect as it do for Winona Ryder Edward Scissorhands and Christina Ricci Sleepy Hollow that is I feel conflict about the character without know exactly why I believe the answer be that blonde and brunette have considerably different skin tone and eye shade far Bancroft have always project a toughness that border on hardness here the blonde hair soften she up a bit though this enable the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston yep she could be a colonel s wife Madison walk a careful balancing act as Riordan handle a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue play a role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache Madison do a more skillful job at itbr br this movie have a Silverado type camaraderie that alone make it worth see it also have memorable performance beautiful scenerary and great action and direction I just hope a letterbox version be available many have be lose because this movie take full advantage of that format,"[[1, 17], [1, 17], [19, 7, 4], [11, 0, 18, 19], [5, 17, 14, 13, 19, 8, 4, 17], [1, 4], [0],

332,ever since I first encounter the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee s she be get to have it I have be sell on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress she receive an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it be well deserve be a masterpiece of understatementbr br Here she simply shine as the guide force and hand in her community this be especially poignant for I for I grow up in this very same time period the production detail be phenomenal and evoke wooooooooooooooonderful memory of life and time during the 50 60 and of woman like Ms Merkerson portray she be thoroughly and ably accompany by a hot hot cast with performance one would enjoy over and over again I first see Macy Gray s name in the credit and go ho hum her performance be so good I do not even recognize she until about a 3rd of the way through I be especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in african american culture that be very tastefully donebr br another very interesting aspect be that the project be less concerned with the racial fabric of the time but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the character and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it be about the choice we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choicesbr br this be a worthy elegant presentation of african american life and be most assuredly destine to become a classic you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collectionbr br i highly recommend,"[[4,

339,note after write this review I see that this listing be indeed about the tv series and not the original film my mistake I think IMDb for a database for movie not tv show but since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not out of ROSENHEIM which strangely be the name this film be list under on IMDb I will leave this comment herebr br Maybe I miss something but when I read that other review it seem to be entirely a review of the CBS series which must have be loosely base on this film I do not see the tv series and I might like it or not but one thing I be sure be that it be very different than this film this film be not like a tv show at all and Whoopie Goldberg be not in it or any other famous Hollywood star other than Jack Palance who be very charming in his rolebr br this be a terribly sweet movie that totally think outside the box it be not at all like a Hollywood formula movie which be probably why the what be a nice word for idiot who decide to market movie or not decide not to market this onebr br first of all this movie capture my heart and imagination from the get go from the music which be just part of the time so you can not really call it a musical to the cinematography to the really cool storybr br a german or bavarian woman very pretty and quite plump get in an argument with the other german or bavarian man with whom she be travel through the California desert with and part way with he he take off in the car and she leave to fend for herself on a deserted and desert like highway out in the middle of nowherebr br She find the small and dilapidated but charming Bagdad Cafe in Bagdad California and check in the rest of the story be magic I do not want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprisebr br warning if you be a racist or have something against big woman you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead be a big woman and character of brown and red skin have large role and be include as part of the mix without any racism involvedbr br I give this film a 10 for orginality entertainment and sheer delightfulness,"[[13, 14, 19, 4], [0, 5, 19, 4, 17], [22, 17, 8, 19, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [17,

would think he could come up with a real life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it but then that be how unrealistic the comedy isbr br but if you be a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedy be make in the 40 you can at least enjoy the amiable cast support he Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey do nicely as his love interest and Conrad Veidt as always make an interesting villain one of his more amusing moment be his reaction to Skelton explain the mystery of wear turban I never know that he muse impress by a minor point that be cleverly introducedbr br all in all typical nonsense that require you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gag as they be not always easy for a discriminate viewer as many of they simply fall flat the way

370,as a longtime admirer of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoir s film making I know that I would inevitably watch his french Cancan soon or later the movie tell a fictionalize story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub the impresario Danglard Jean Gabin try to turn Montmartre laundress Nini Franoise Arnoul into a cancan star without arouse the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the belly dance Lola Maria Felix this be just one of several love triangle in french cancantrue to stereotype these french showbiz folk be always fall in lovebr br Renoir direct with his typical gentle humor and attention to support character and also write the lyric to a beautiful waltz song prominently feature in the movie Gabin perfectly incarnate the age french playboy hero Arnoul be a cute redhead who hold her own in the dance number except for a few trick shot where a double be obviously usedbr br french cancan be bill as a musical comedy and while there be lot of musical number that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character Casimir ever break into song in the middle of conversation the actor who play he Philippe Clay be fun to watch a really tall skinny young man who sing dance and do contortionsbr br The movie end with a long cancan sequence as all the character learn to triumph over their problem and make art together the dancing be much more brightly light and coherently edit than in Moulin Rouge in fact if I have one complaint about french Cancan it be that the whole thing be a little too Technicolor even when Nini experience heartbreak or someone sing a melancholy song the lighting be bright and flat no shadow intrude yes the result be a cheerful and warmhearte musical comedy it be just that I can not help think that thing be not ever this colorful and innocent in real life,"[[0, 18], [0], [11, 14, 13, 6, 19, 8, 12, 4], [0, 3, 12, 8, 17, 4, 17], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [28, 26, 26, 27], [5, 8, 11, 12],

374,Jean Renoir s homage to the Paris of the late 19th century be beautiful in many way not only do it appear to have be photograph by Toulouse Lautrec and Mucha it portray the geographic Paris the street accessible only by staircase the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of man with a product to sell in an uncompromise picture of show business that be in stark contrast with the picture paint by Hollywood there be an obvious comparison to be make with Lloyd Bacon s 42nd Street which have be make about 20 year before feature Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation a fresh face kid from the stick who have come to New York to get into show business who save the show when the star failsyoure go out there a kid from the chorus but you have get to come back a STAR Warner Baxter s Julian Marsh be a director who suffer for his art and be unappreciated Jean Gabin s Danglard keep run afoul of genital politic but when he talk about the show he be more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh he be all about the game except for his pointy thing he have a profitable new venture sew up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognize as his next mistress his prospect rise and fall with every coital journey he take br br Danglard take Mistress 1 Lola de Castro play by Maria Felix slum to a dive where he see Nini Franoise Arnoul with her boyfriend and first lover Paulo the baker and discover that she be a spirited dancer he use his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to study dancing so that she may go on the stage the prospect of money and fame charm Nini and she become Danglard s next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which Danglard have dub french Cancan to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dancebr br Both 42nd St and french Cancan be tribute to show business to modern entertainment that have be own iconography and its own conceit 42nd St be center around Julian Marsh a great director of Broadway show which he organize with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement the male juvenile be a middle aged twit with lumbago replace by Dick Powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide Danglard on the other hand go from woman to woman seduce they with the promise of fame hook they with what must have be a very persuasive endowment one have no doubt that he be heterosexual and quite active postcoital scene aboundbr br Days after seduce Nini away from Paulo he have discover Esther a Piaf type and begin to prepare she for her job of singe the film s theme song while he play it on her fiddle that of course arouse Nini s jealousy just as she have arouse the jealousy of Lola and of course Nini have already forswear the privilege of be a Czarina the whole movie be about how Danglard s concupiscence have cost he money but how even his troublesome horniness be subordinate to his love for the show how the audience demand devotion and it be this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempt fame that make Danglard the hero while assert that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money man at the movie s conclusion Danglard having outfox the creditor and the jealous babe approach a new attraction watch the incredible and believe I it be incredible performance of the cancan have you ever think about be on the stage he ask and the curtain descend meanwhile poor Julian be sit of the fire escape of the theatre listen to Peggy Sawyer s new fan disparage his contribution to the show s success I will not even go into 42nd Street s central line oh Guy it be grand of you to come br br Furthermore I will not go into the glimpse one get of legendary parisian entertainer include a brief vision of Piaf nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural certainly there be a sample of the style that engender Trenet and Aznavour but it be the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compare be a pleasant relief from the androgyne of 30 s Hollywood musical include my beloved Fred Astaire not to mention Dick Powell let alone the barf promulgate by MGM in movie like the repulsive american in Paris all those fountain we will save our comparison of that turkey to Breakfast at Tiffany s and its deconstruction of the american male for another daybr br That Danglard may have be a hopeful vision in postwar France of a kind of hyper masculine mec that may or may not have ever exist be practically beside the point that he be a man s man neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton be perhaps more on target that he be a man who like the lady be never in question I for one would not mind live his life at all I wonder if Gabin be that lucky br br At the beginning of this comment I want to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis call boloney I never get that far Baz s Moulin Rouge well Paris do not put that kind of stuff in the Seine

378,although it do not seem very promising for a long stretch Renoir s french Cancan end up be an effortlessly charming film the story be clich a laundry girl Nini Franoise Arnoul be discover by a night club owner Danglard Jean Gabin Danglard steal she from her baker boyfriend and drop his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lover Nini have to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince fall in love with she at one point too I be glad the film do not go for the most obvious choice as a less film certainly would have the film end with the opening of Danglard s new night club the Moulin Rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance number the first of they Complainte de la Butte which also provide the base of most of the film s musical score be simply one of the most gorgeous song ever write and Renoir himself write it if you be a fan of Baz Luhrmann s 2001 film Moulin Rouge you will recognize the tune as it come up near the beginning of that film sing by Rufus Wainwright although it be not very prominent in that film everyone I know who own the soundtrack love it in addition to have one of the most lovely song ever write french Cancan also boast one of the cut lead lady ever to grace the screen it be hard not to fall head over heel in love with that girl

something of the great Broadway performance as wellbr br but he do other movie that show his talent as well as the king and i his comic turn in once MORE with feeling be quite nice so be his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Ramses in the TEN commandment yet he come terribly close to be a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as the man you love to hate a certain vulnerability in his acting and role endear he to the movie public even after his good year as a star be behind he and he retreat more and more to repeat the King of Siam on television and the stagebr br to I his fine performance be in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr Jason Robards Jr Robert Morley E G Marshall Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard the film be set in pretty modern time the powder keg that be Hungary in 1956 when briefly it look like the Iron Curtain be about to collapse there under the reform of hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporter but the Hungarian Revolution collapse due to bad timing the Russians and their polish and east german ally send tank in to crush the revolt and arrest and execute Nagy and other reformer the West stand by and let this happen England and France have gotten catch in the Suez crisis and the US have berate they and Israel for attack Egypt due to the action of three close ally of the US the West find it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union it be an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians have never forget how they be abandon in itbr br In the film Brynner be Major Surov a russian intelligence officer who be watch for some of the leader of the hungarian revolt one of whom be Paul Kedes Jason Robards kede may be get assistance from some westerner on a bus tour through Hungary lead by Robert Morley include Marshall Jackson and Howard and Kerr the latter be be keep in a hotel while their bus be be repair and Brynner mingle with they hope for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards but Brynner be human he try to be ingratiate with these people all of whom see he as a monster and in sequence when he have drink a little too much he confront they with the question that have bother historian since 1945 how be it even if one note that Russia have Stalin in charge that relation between Russia and the West collapse so quickly the ally on the whole have work well together from 1941 to 1945 but after Yalta and Potsdam all type of mutual suspicion just erupt do they have to Surov be a good officer but he be tear in half by loyalty to the communist regime in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he support and his grow fondness towards Kerr who be hide Robards but be also willing to note the more human side of the russian major and as the film reach it be tragic climax we watch as Surov have to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on Kerr Robards and the other westerner who want to leave it become a true struggle for he and one that he may win far too late it be a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portray,"[[12, 14, 18, 19], [15, 4, 14, 15, 11, 4], [22, 8, 11, 11], [2, 14, 13, 18, 8, 3, 4, 17], [19, 7, 0, 19],

391,the Journey be a very good film produce in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and release in 1959 this movie be quite popular in his early year despite the political problem which influence the movie s success because the story happen during the Hungarian Revolution the Cold War the Journey be a very good film but not well know I think it should be release immediately on DVD because most of the people who have see it so far want to have it at home one of the most important quality of the film be the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner their intense relationship all their scene together be very important but they also reveal the strong feeling the great passion and love between the character Major Surov and Diana Ashmore another quality be the script which be very well written it be even publish as a novel by the screen player George Tabori the film keep its tension from the beginning to the end at first we do not know if Diana and the other traveler could leave Hungary because the Communist Major discover that Diana s friend Paul Kedes be hungarian and he be not allow to leave the country the Major fall deeply in love with Diana and this be in fact the true reason why he do not want to let she go but after he embrace she and give she one of the most memorable kiss ever see on screen and she kiss he too he let she go and the end of the film be one of the most dramatic ending ever film the Major and Diana say Goodbye she arrive at the frontier with all the traveler include Paul while Surov be shoot several time by some Hungarians so he die Yul Brynner be very very handsome and Deborah Kerr be very beautiful charming refined just like an English Lady Yul and Deborah be perfect together they be one of the great couple of the Golden Hollywood a true moviegoer should watch this film the Journey have everything that a good film should have a great captivate story interesting character a wonderful direction Anatole Litvak be in my opinion at his good finally I want to give a message to Warner Bros Studios or those who restore and release classic film please release the Journey on DVD as soon as possible,"[[19, 7, 4], [9, 14, 20, 17, 13,

396,I have see several Yul Brynner film yet this be his good performance as the camera capture his emotion in close up as he snarl smile and laugh Brynner might have be equally arrest in Ten Commandments Taras Bulba the Magnificent Seven the Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these film have capture his range of talent in close up as in this one he be arrest and tantalize to watch in every shotbr br equally fascinating and sexy without remove her clothe be Deborah Kerr the script allow she to exude a sensuality that be not visual but suggestive she reprise this sort of role year later in the Night of Iguana the film do not suggest that she sleep with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutch of the Russians in fact she be show as run away from the russian Major in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story yet the film burst with suggest but real physical allure of the Kerr characterbr br Kerr can never be classify as a beautiful actress in my view but she be a superb actress she put her soul into dignify the character that she portray which often clash with the spirit of the character it be this contradiction that make her role in the journey Quo Vadis and the Night of Iguana memorablebr br why be this an unusual film it be not easy in Hollywood to see russian character portray as good people Dr Zhivago be an exception Brynner s Romance of a Horse Thief be again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledge as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post McCarthy erabr br The film be also unusual in its casting great french actor Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee rub shoulder with Jason Robards Jr and british actor Robert Morley in many way the film be international than American all four be great actor and add to the entertainmentbr br Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen s work will find the film be not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitize censor version have a dignified charm of its own provide by the reality of the night that lead to the release of the group I think Litvak deserve to have the last laugh in provide an interesting and plausible twist to the tale that lead to the making of the film while entwine bit of both write tale eg the last bus ride and the final kissbr br but I do have one grouse why do Hollywood never acknowledge the source that inspire the story only recently eg Insomnia have the original work begin to be mention prominently in the credit,"[[8], [7, 0, 21, 4], [18, 4, 4], [18, 4,

397,Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story have all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigner attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria however three thing complement the story make this an extremely good moviebr br First the actor use the actual language of their role the russian soldier speak only russian the Hungarians only Hungarian the Germans only german except to the minimal extent to tell the story since Debra Kerr be English she speak only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few other essential to the story also speak heavily accented English as a result the empathy of the audience to the traveler become paramount the viewer share all the confusion and suspense of be involve in an illicit border crossing when he she can not understand any of the language speak around they very powerful feeling be arouse in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign language the audience be never at a loss for follow the film no subtitle be necessarybr br second I be in Hungary in 1995 and I be tell you this movie have it right on from the gypsy music overpower the dinner meal to the underground cavern in the building where much of the action take place to the village scene the realism be incredible if I do not eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I eat at its double I think that I actually walk down the main street in that village actually the film be shoot in Austriabr br Third and most important this movie reunite Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner after the King and I and the magnetism between they as the story unfold be nothing short of Oscar qualified of course Yul already receive an Oscar for play that relationship so the Acadamy be not go to give he another one but

398,the Journey be a romantic version of the cold war it be about an english woman Deborah Kerr try to smuggle her former love a hungarian scientist Jason Robards Jr out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956 she be on board a bus with thirteen other international people who be try to get out of Hungary through the austrian borderbr br of course the bus get stop by the Russians for a security check the russian officer in charge Yul Brynner becomes attract to the english woman Deborah Kerrand delay the trip of course the russian officer know the truth about the hungarian scientist posing as a british citizen but he decide not to arrest the scientist because he be wait for the english woman to come to he of course this all sound absurd but it be a fun movie to watch despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr Brynner and Ms Kerr which seem inappropriate in the situation that they be in the movie become suspenseful and interesting the good acting override some of the silly dialogue perhaps some people involve in the Hungarian Revolt would not appreciate this movie they would consider it a piece of fluff br br this be my favorite Yul Brynner role he speak with his own masculine voice and be very attractive especially when he become vulnerable this be Deborah Kerr s second time work with Yul Brynner since they make the King and I in 1956 they make a very attractive couple too bad they never work again this be the second sexy role Ms Kerr take since from here to eternity despite the fact that Ms Kerr be wear heavy winter clothe throughout the movie she be very beautiful and sensual br br The fine support cast be head by Jason Robards Jr in his first film role some of the international cast be recognizable like for instance Robert Morley from England however the rest of the actor I have never see before or since be just great in the movie in the background it be fun to see Senta Berger as one of the maid speak a few line of Hungarian a few year later in 1966 she be in a movie cast a Giant Shadow with Yul Brynner as his lead lady she be still work today,"[[19, 7, 4], [9, 14, 20, 17, 13, 4, 24], [1, 4], [0], [17, 14, 12, 0, 13, 19, 8, 2], [21,

407,I have actually consider invest in this movie when Gorman be out drum up funding I love most of the script but do not like the ending Gorman insist the ending be as it have to bebr br seee the complete movie I have to say I be amazed read the script I have not imagine the act and Gorman s directing would be as powerful and move as it be here the two lead do an amazing job they be very believable and this movie be well worth watch just for the performance of these two amazing starsbr br now for the spoiler and if you have not see the movie please do not read far as you need to see the movie first I actually wish I have never read the script just so I could have experience the movie end first hand br br SPOILER br br I have two main problem with the movie first off and I be sure I mention this when I read the script the wife should have die if she be dead the ending would be much more believable as it be we have this guy who have be agonize over a woman who leave he year ago if she leave he and he be still in love after so long he would have to be seriously delusional but he do not come across that way in the script there be also the problem of why he do not expend all this energy go after the wife he still lovesbr br Plus if the wife be dead we would actually be able to believe that they have a fulfilling reciprocate love and therefore believe that the guy be devastate enough for the ending to be reasonablebr br However I do not buy Daphne do what she do in the ending I would need a heck of a lot of convince to believe that this naive girl very naive for a whore but believable due to Bohl s performance do what she do the character be simply not cold enough and if she do this out of some kind of love or something else then there be a whole piece of the movie story missingbr br much of this movie be reminiscent of Sex Lies and Video Tape I think it could have be as popular if Gorman have choose to give the movie a more believable ending br br So watch the movie enjoy the performance and make up your own mind,"[[8], [7, 0, 21, 4], [0, 2, 19, 20, 0, 11, 11, 24], [2, 14, 13, 18, 8, 3, 4, 17], [8, 13, 21, 4, 18, 19], [8, 13], [19, 7, 8, 18], [12,

413,I be a film director nightmare especially of the mega buck multiplex variety while not a student of the art I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buy into the film maker s vision if I can find it that be why a gem such as you be alone be such an exhilarate find the intimacy and pacing draw I in and never let I go Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuance performance and director Gorman Bechard display a deft hand in present what be an understandably disturbing day in the life of two terribly damage peoplebr br spoiler below br br I buy the DVD version and have share it with several people the reaction have be vary from disbelief in the ability of Daphne to complete the assignment for which Buddy have pay she to an inability to watch the whole film because it be just too real and emotionally devastating as a compulsively skeptical moviegoer I have to be either grab by the collar and haul for the ride or sidle up to and seduce by the filmmaker this film take the later route for I and by the end I be so involved that I feel Daphne s horror and pain at her role in Buddy s demise my reaction to this film remind I of watch the Cook the thief his Wife and her Lover by Peter Greenaway many many year ago by the end I be fascinated and repel and utterly unable to tear my eye away from that film too I have watch this film several time now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director have demonstrate I be familiar with other work he have be do include a couple of cheeky movie Galactic Gigolo and Attack of the Killer Bimbos and a mixed bag the Kiss which I recently learn be kill in the cradle by the producer and do not really represent the director vision too bad because I love the prior two film and even find the Kiss interesting but wish the Kiss be available in a director s cut with all of the original vision and music in tact I look forward to future work by this interesting director and the lead Jessica Bohl and Richard

414,you be alone be a beautiful almost delicate film smart direct crisply write with two complex and riveting performance and a twist of an ending that no one will see come but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clue you misreadbr br The story about a highschool girl who drown her depression and awkwardness by work a few hour a week as a 500 an hour schoolgirl escort and the depressed next door neighbor who discover her secret and hire she for an afternoon call in a downtown New Haven hotel feature breathtaking performance from both Jessica Bohl as the girl and Richard Brundage as she neighborbr br Bohl as Daphne give a breakthrough performance on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary she so capture a teenager s angst of grow into her own skin and when she talk about always be in control you start to realize she be not in control at all but in danger of go over the deep end which I guess in a way she doesbr br Brundage as Buddy be depressed angry heartbroken a shell of a man but it be not until the film s startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of his painbr br After a very brief opening segment which will hook most independent film lover and have the religious right run towards the exit we be bring into the hotel room at first you be not sure about these people or the film make style shaky annoying like the character until you realize their back story tell in short flashback they be confrontational at first for a reason and so be the camera but as they open up as the story settle down likewise so do the camera and I do not know 20 minute in give or take you find yourself unable to take your eye away from the screenbr br have just see the world premiere screen at the Brooklyn Film Fest where the director ask the audience if anyone expect the ending and not one person answer yes I almost wish the film be already on video so I could watch it again because think back now on some of the conversation in the film particularly a very candid dialog regard fantasy and climax I really think thing be go in a very different direction but I realize now so much of their conversation mean something completely different than what I imagine I need to see it again but as dark and sexual as much of the talk be blunt to say the least I find myself laugh more than I might have expect at some of its candor which definitely fall into the thing we think but lack the nerve to say out loud category it be very blunt especially when you realize so much of it have a completely different meaning some of it will make you uncomfortable especially if you be watch you be alone with a partner you will definitely have something to talk about perhaps argue about afterwards perhaps it should come with a warning you should be alone when watch the music be amazing I would have come home and purchase the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if I could have the film look as good as anything shoot on film after the screening director Gorman Bechard be ask what sort of process he use to get the digital footage to look so good his answer none they could not afford itbr br I have to give Bechard credit I be a big fan of his two short the Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror but even they could not have prepare I for the complexity and surprise of this filmbr br To everyone

424,there be time I be convinced that the Mikado be the good Sullivan Gilbert opera ever but that be only so long as I be not listen to Iolanthe be that as it may the Mikado be probably the most frequently film of the Savoy Operas yes I put the composer first nobody say Hammerstein and Rodgers or Hart and Rodgers or Boito and Verdi or Whats his face and Strauss you do not even hear the name of librettist for Offenbach Suppe or Balfe Gilbert be just the big name and the big ego at the time so they put his name first it be time that silly practice be put to restbr br anyway the Mikado be a compleat sg operetta it have some of Sullivan s catchiest number combine with some of Gilbert s clever lyric it have an interesting book and sprightly dialogue it be get a wonderful degree of craziness and it leave the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costumingbr br this particular production film in a live performance in 1990 turn its imagination toward strike simplicity Set in a british seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period it throw over the japonerie of the original entirely the result be costume and set in an eye caress medley of white grey and black accent by occasional bit of red and less frequent use of yellow and green it take some getting use to but it be really spiffy of course when the chorus tell you they be gentleman of Japan you would be right to exclaim oh pooh Bah do I just say that it be most gratifying that this fine production be now on DVD however one caveat the print seem to be photograph through a glass of imperfect clarity so that the expect sharpness of the image be soften and ever so slightly fuzzy the tendency to superimpose image be alas annoying why do people who be do a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy fartsy stuff of that sort but it be the performance that count the most we may skip the overture since although one be perform Sullivan never write one true it may be so he write none for any of the Savoys but the Mikado overture do not even date from Sullivan s lifetime and be compile by observe the technique use in the other as for the rest of the operetta it be first rate and supremely funnybr br The Ko Ko here be the estimable Eric Idle who do it credit there be a tradition of bring a big Name into the role the be a US tv production year ago in which Ko Ko be play by Groucho Marx with mixed result Idle s performance be delightfully quirky he do take from a county jail assist by a tennis racquet his I have get a Little list be do as a speech to a microphone of course it have the usual update lyric which be much funny than the usual run of such thing and his delivery be positively hysterical it go on that way throughoutbr br In this operetta it be important to have a good Katisha it be just no fun if you be not be bellow at in style this Mikado have a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer in her way almost as Big a name as Idle she bellow with the good of they in a wonderful rich contralto wonderful especially for a soprano and her costume not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt apparently accompanying Nanki Poo be play by Bonaventura Bottone I have trouble get around be somewhat un nanki pooish chubby shortness but be voice be undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette there be a nice touch during a wandring Minstrel where the chorus react with distaste to the mention of his nancy on his knee bear in mind the Mikado s decree about flirt be that as it may Bottone be a fine singing actor and if his appearance do not put the good face on Nanki Poo his performance doesbr br yum Yum Lesley Garett and her friend be appropriately pretty and silly she and Bottone do lovely duet Pish Tush Mark Richardson play his persona as something a blageur and do it very well Poo Bah Richard Van Allan be wonderful as a stuff shirt out of water a role later do to death in american sitcom you know haughty butler force to cater to bratty child that sort of thing the Mikado Richard Angas be bloody marvelous with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyricsbr br i do not recommend you get this as your only Mikado get a good traditional production as well so you can see what Gilbert intend more or less in term of staging that be say I will watch this one twice while view any traditional bit once on the whole this be a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious over act it be a dvd to treasure with dervish like maid tap dancing bellhop and all watch for the bellhop with sign,"[[19,

426,I really enjoy this particular production of the Mikado the producer add a few touch throughout to make it more amusing for modern audience for instance as some day it may happen the little list song be completely update and a few line be ad libbe throughout the play liberty be also take with the setting the costume be not japanese but rather 1920s English although some of the tittipudlian girl wear 20 inspire kimono this production be well choreograph with some 1920s dance style and there be some extra dancing maid and bellhop to keep your eye as well as ear entertain during the song if you be a Gilbert Sullivan purist these change may bother you but I think they be fine and I love the costume br br Felicity Palmer Katisha be absolutely hilarious all of her scene make I laugh out loud one of my favorite add ons be when she first make an entrance the dancing bellhop annoy she with their antic so she screech at the top of her voice stop it all of the other main character do a fine job as well I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish Tush that toupee and Lesley Garrett as Yum Yumbr br You must keep in mind that this be a stage production be film and set your expectation accordingly there be no change of set although the filmmaker use some 1930 film technique to add interest if there be one draw back to this production it be that the stage makeup be not modify for close up shot with a camera foundation line be often visible and there seem to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere I have see this sort of thing happen before with film of play and it be a little jarring at first however I hope you will get use to it and enjoy the Mikado for what it be worth a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic,"[[8], [17, 4, 0, 11, 11, 24], [4, 13, 9,

433,okay sure this movie be a bit on the hokey side it be difficult to take character from comic book and put they into movie with any credibility Dolph Lundgren as the Punisher anyone but this try very hard I have never read the actual comic book but that do not really matter I suppose I judge a film mainly on its merit not on whether it be a faithful retelling of someone else s idea unless its a film base on a true story that demand at least some attempt at truth and accuracy so why will I give this movie a fairly high rating because it try it try very hard in my book that make it a fair attempt at an entertaining filmbr br Many film have be make with vampire subject matter be the main focus it seem everybody have their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever some of those idea be include here the storyline be familiar a group of vampire conspire to take over the world with one person mainly stand in their way Blade Wesley Snipes live for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masse who have slowly but surely move into the world and share it with humankind for the most part the human race be blind to the fact that vampire exist all around they the vampire have even take familiar people who aspire to be vampire and do the vampire dirty work for they to show how worthy they be of eventually be turn br br Now that I think of it there be many element of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film they live a hidden enemy hidden group of people plot against they the fight to save human kind all that be present in Blade as wellbr br The acting be not the good here snipe be at good only slightly well than some of his other role NBushe Wright a relative newcomer be not too bad Kris Kristofferson be forgettable as Blade s sidekick he be to blade what Chip be to the Punisher Stephen Dorff do the good job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hatebr br i do not know but I just love the special effect in this film from the blood soak vampire style rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effect be not half bad there be certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this be a vampire movie right the various shape and sort of weaponry Blade use be fairly unique and not generally use in contemporary action film snipe have more flair with a deck out sword than he do with say a machine gun plus there be so much more thought that go into fighting with a blade than just blow someone away unless of course you be Indiana Jonesbr br Overall this be not the good action film ever make but it be not half bad either as a bonus the musical score soundtrack be pretty cool too tell I in what other movie can you hear super drumnbass like Source Direct or Photekbr br My rating 810,"[[14, 10, 0, 24], [18, 20, 17, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [1, 4], [0], [1, 8, 19], [14, 13], [19, 7, 4], [7,

452,overall I give this film a decent 76 to start I will say I love how the character be portray and adapt on to the screen if you read comicstrip occasionally or simply watch dvd extra you will see the Blade character be drastically different from the one we see in the film among the change Blade be now most importantly half vampire therefore acquire all of their strength but none of their weakness the credit for this go obviously to David Goyer a fellow fan of the dark genre of comic book thank to he Blade have become a much more interesting character and I find he one of my favorite anti hero really Wesley Snipes be bear to play this role although some would ve probably pererre Dezenel Washington or Will Smith lol his acting here do not need to be exactly Oscar win per say consider the character but I be glad he decid to play the DayWalker in the two sequel also star be Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade s Alfred so to speak the acting be good actually and the action keep the plot go for sure the opening scene in the club be one of my favorite part I have get to say as much as like this movie there be few thing that bother I which take away from this film rank with something like Spider Man or x men Stephen Norrington have the villain portray in a way I do not like so much honestly their line be so full of foul mouthed comedy it do not really feel like a comic book film to I plus La Magra a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight make up for it I guess not to mention a sense of extra non realism a black man in a leather coat with a sword beae the out of a cop in broad day light some how go unnoticed by the crowd walk by seem kinda well dumb move away from a few of its flaw the music by Mark Isham be great and fit the film nicely luckily all these problem be fix and improve on in the stunning sequel Blade 2,"[[14, 21, 4, 17, 0, 11, 11], [8], [6, 8, 21, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [5, 8, 11, 12],

457,it seem to I that a lot of people do not know that Blade be actually a superhero movie on par with x men Daredevil Punisher and the like what all these hero and in the case of x men hero group have in common be that they be all conceive in the magical world of Marvel Blade be originally a normal person in a blue outfit who chase vampire because of a personal grudge and eventually face of with Dracula himself and he be for lack of a well word boring so boring in fact that the character be shelve and in fact never use in the Marvel universe at least until he be reinventedbr br David Goyer do a stroke of genius when he take the character of Blade and turn he into a leather clothe dark knight he can not take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style bring out the good of the character the Blade character Wesley Snipes be pretty amazing in this film and mix martial art with Batman like darkness snipe be pretty good as the title character and be successful in bring out the duality and inner demon of the character he be however a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and be only interesting enough for one film which be clearly see from the inferior sequel Kris Kristofferson be good as well and really bring the torment character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing NBushe Wright however be fairly weak as a lead lady make her character relatively flat and lifeless Donal Logue be pretty funny and manage to do a lot with a minor character german Udo Kier should also be mention as he bring a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race probably bear of his experience from play Dracula Stephen Dorf provide the good acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stand as one of the good screen villain I have perhaps ever seenbr br The story be good and I feel renew the vampire genre something that have not be do since Robert Rodrigues from Dusk till Dawn by add a lot of contemporary element and maintain the comic book feel by say that the film have a comic book feel do not mean that the film be unrealistic far from it a lot of effort have be put in try to make the film seem as real as possible include the effect which be pretty good for their time I find the vampire dusting to be a very nice touch in stead of add a lot of blood when a vampire die Norrington choose to let the vampire spontaneously com bust which look great the fact that the overall effect be well do add to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fall flat on its facebr br As previously state Norrington have a very distinct visual style that set he apart from the director of the following Blade movie Del Toro be nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington s style his style give the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it give the film atmosphere a very tense dark atmosphere which work great in tune with the main character and story along with the visual style the music which also work fine and add a lot to the atmosphere of the moviebr br all in all Blade be a very entertaining movie that should probably have have an 8 from I but a few annoying flaw which can not be reveal without spoil the movie suffice to say many of they be locate near the ending of the film do that the film must settle with a high 7br br

461,now here be a movie that do something that have not be do in a long time it take ten or so different element that we be already familiar with Vampires martial art a techno beat top o the line special effect etc and turn it into something that feel brand new in what could have easily be merely a combination of mortal Kombat and buffy the Vampire Slayer Wesley Snipes no favorite of mine since and mostly because of passenger 57 give a really good turn as the half human half bloodsucker he acknowledge the internal conflict but do not dwell on it more than necessary he make Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton make Batmanbr br Ill say that the only part of the movie that get I a little miffed be the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happen to know who happen to know exactly how to stop the evil guy on the other hand you sort of have to have that in a movie like this so it be easily excusablebr br Well Snipes be good and Steven Dorff hype in the preview make a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes hero he be get class presence and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to tone it down a bit who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launch pad for an actor I sincerely hope this be and whoa where the heck do Kris Kristofferson get act talent do not get I wrong but the prolific actor have not do anything memorable since Millennium and how many of we watch that just cause of the cool video box well here he be folk in a very obi wanish turn as Blade s mentor and father figure and good job toobr br The quality of the acting be match by the quality of the choreography and special effect accompany by a pulse techno beat the fight scene bring back and quickly banish memory of Mortal Kombat hey it have a script too I be wonder what have happen to all the good writer out therebr br the two major indication to I that I see a quality flick be these I have no feeling of remorse about pay full price to get in a la any Schumacher Batman the Avengers MK Annihilation Godzilla or Armageddon wow how many of those come out this year Ugh also I look forward to the inevitable sequel as per the film s ending let us just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first onebr br,"[[13, 14, 22], [7, 4, 17, 4], [1, 4], [0], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [19, 7, 0, 19], [3, 14], [18, 14, 12, 4, 19, 7, 8,

it be during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in Black begin her reign of terror she plan to avenge her own fate by possess Jane and sacrifice her companion and her unborn child each of her other victim fulfill an aspect of her vengeful curse greed lust and the blood of a virgin as the sun go down and the sea become wild she haunt they one by one in gruesome horrify way the island location be effectively scary and the inn be very creepy and hauntingly shoot it be such a colorful film that it remind I of Dario Argento s work the lighting be excellent and the set decoration be perfectly spooky the soundtrack be very effective and unique the horror effect be extreme terrifying and unforgettable the cinematography be great and it be this that bring we back to Linda Blair the creative team behind this film shoot she like a horror star should be shoot lot of dramatic push in linger close up that subtly detail Jane s incremental possession and moment that be reminiscent of other great horror film there be hide homage to Rosemary s Baby Jacob s Ladder the shine Black Sunday and of course the exorcist she do a great job and absolutely steal the show with her moody and understated performance that be not to say that the rest of the cast disappoint Catherine Hickland be sexy and very good and veteran performer Annie Ross be memorable as Jane s bitchy mother Rose Hasselhoff give it his good but he be not essentially a film star and his television persona get in the way of his performance Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together the film be otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately need their warmth Blair also play a mother in 2003 s Monster maker and her maternal scene in that film have the same tender feeling to they lastly Hildegard Knef in one of her last role play a great witch and she have the most amazing voice and accent along with Blair she be also perfectly cast but it be Blair s movie all the way Jane Brooks also seem to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearken back to Exorcist II the heretic I think Witchery be up there with the exorcist Exorcist II Hell Night and Summer of Fear as Blair s good genre work to date,"[[11, 8, 13, 3, 0], [1, 11, 0, 8, 17], [7, 0, 21, 4], [1, 4], [0, 2, 19], [5, 14, 17], [5, 14, 17, 19, 24], [24, 4, 0, 17], [13, 14, 22],

468,Witchery or Witchcraft as it be commonly know in Europe being with Jane Brooks Linda Blair wake up from a nightmare involve a witch Jane s Mother Father Rose Annie Ross Freddie Robert Champagne be interested in buy an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 mile from Boston renovate it reopen it together with Jane their young son Tommy Michael Manchester Rose Freddie be plan to travel to the island with an architect name Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland to check on the amount of work that need do they also meet up with the estate agent Jerry Giordano Rick Farnsworth hire a local fisherman name Sam George Stevens to take they to the island once there they enter the hotel begin to inspect the property while back on the boat Sam be kill the boat be let loose to sail off into the distance they discover two unexpected guest in the shape of a photographer name Gary David Hasselhoff his virgin fianc Leslie Leslie Cumming who happen to be research a book that she be write about the gruesome legend superstition surround the infamous island hotel as the night draw on a rage storm outside isolate they from the mainland as a mysterious lady in black Hildegard Knef keep pop up as the ancient evil that reside in the hotel seek fresh victim for demonic possession human sacrifice Satanic rite br br the director of this american italian co produce film be somewhat shroud in mystery as the IMDb list Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin but there be rumour that Joe DAmato do the honour either way to be honest despite it be bad reputation I find Witchery quite entertain in a so bad its good cheesy sort of way the script credit to Harry Spalding Daniele Stroppa on the IMDb again be confuse too as the actual credit on the film itself be Daniel Davis anyway whoever write this thing do a decent job please stop laugh at heart it be a haunt house horror but add some gory death a surreal feeling to everything the different set of character have reasonable motive do not get on my nerve as much as I would think they might it be not plot very well it do not make a whole a lot of sense the dialogue be not exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole Witchery entertain I for it be 95 odd minute duration plain simple it be reasonably well paced a little slow to get go maybe but there be plenty of surreal bizarre going on gruesome death to keep one amuse one part of Witchery which destroy some of it be credibility be this so call storm there be no storm in sight the sea be probably calm enough to swim in Witchery s suppose twist ending do not really work for I either just check out the dumb expression on Cummings face on that final freeze frame the hotel provide for a good isolated location add a certain atmosphere to the film which have the distinctive indefinable horror feel throughout cheap horror at that Technically Witchery be not too bad at all it be obviously shoot on location so it look good throughout while not exactly the pinnacle of film make finesse it be overall production value be slightly well than expect the violence gore be of typical Euro explicitness a woman have her lip sew shut hang inside a fireplace so she can not scream as the other light it someone be crucify then burn alive impale on a swordfish someone vein expand pop a woman be rape by a man with no lip Witchery be shoot in English so there be no dubbing as far as acting go David Hasselhoff Linda Blair in the same film what more can I say yes lady Hasselhoff do take his shirt off for the lad Cummings take hers off both Hasselhoff Blair be a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid be very annoying really can not act at all I sure most sane film goer will disagree with my opinion but I still stand by the fact that I like it would happily watch it again Witchery be pretty good fun definitely worth a watch if your into bad film or your a horror fan in general,"[[22, 8, 19, 2, 7, 4, 17, 24], [14, 17], [22, 8, 19, 2, 7, 2, 17, 0, 5, 19], [0,

470,during the making of this movie I once catch a statement on television about it something like be Killinggnget now take off Nazismbr br So my comprehension of this movie be from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism when recently see this movie in the tv version I have this filter before I and it be not difficult to see thisbr br strangely enough I have not meet this way of interpret the film ever since I first hear itbr br These be the thing I find in four shade of brown in all four of the story the lack of empathy lead to disasterbr br 1 the crematory worker show no realistic empathy to the dead animal or to those who have to say goodbye to they in the crematory room in deal with death and fire it be almost like a cheerful game to he the seriousness of death and fire be not emphasize by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance push a button that lead to the disaster that injure his father severelybr br possible lesson the importance of show the young adequate emotion when they grow up they need to know what behavior lead to disaster and what emotion lead to goodbr br 2the magician maneuver his wife like an invisible puppeteer just when she think she have begin to cut off the string to the masters hand reach for personality integrity and joy he pull hard and she be back in desolation and despairbr br Their son have try to revolt in create his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parent bad taste the real problem he be carry within be far from comprehensible to he his father behavior pass on when suffocate his own wife in his spotless environmentbr br possible lesson oppression breed bondagebr br 3The father who be abuse as a child pass on sadism to his child when he cheat they on their inheritance he rob they of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritancebr br possible lesson when no love give you can not give anybr br 4the father abuse of his daughter create in she a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression here the ice cold Nazi sadism become very obvious in physical violence it give a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the action of young scin headnazist behavior when oppress other br br possible lesson can Nazism take birth in a pervert homebr br Can the hideous consequence of ignore empathy in family life in the long run be that room be give to sadistic Nazism br br Very seldom do a movie contain so much it reveal little by little as I meditate on it I consider it brilliantly paint and the actor be superb especially the nice seem bloke play by Ulf

481,Adam Sandler s movie be my favorite comedy the silence of the Lambs be my favorite horror movie the Matrix be my favorite sci fi movie anywhere but here be my favorite dramabr br Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie have be it be actingbr br Susan Sarandon be absolutely amazing by the end of this movie I feel as if I know her character well than I know myself she do a simply amazing jobbr br Natalie Portman also do a great job I recently rent her first movie Leon 1994 in which she play a 12 year old girl I believe that she be a contradiction in term she be a good kid actress well 5 year later she be still just as good an actress in fact she be much betterbr br Not only do Sarandon and Portman portray their character well but they also work perfectly together I mean even now I can hardly believe that they be not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this moviebr br this movie be about a 14 year old girl Portman and her restless mother Sarandon that leave their home town in Wisconsin for Beverly Hillsbr br At first Portman hate her mother for take she away from her cousin and friend and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that go up and down over the course of a couple year usually down might I addbr br Although this explanation be a little vague the plot can only be summarize vaguely but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really be not so vague or weak for it be actually very deep what I be say be that the plot be outline weakly but then they focus in on it to make it strongbr br and it be very strong but also the plot sequence be great and there be a few brilliant scene that I hope will someday be see as classicbr br I love this movie I laugh I cry and although admittedly there be a few loophole it be still a stellar movie and it really come together in the end,"[[0, 3, 0, 12], [18, 0, 13, 3, 11, 4, 17], [18], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [1, 4], [12, 24], [5, 0, 21, 14, 17, 8, 19, 4], [2,

man I be think look like sister have a medicare scam go get folk job and take the medicare caid check but no she explain to Lou Gosset she just want 25 buck a week and do not want the money ahead of time I think that part be put in the movie just for we jade New Yorkers so we know she be not scamme the poor folksg it be write by a New Yorker so he know the dealg she almost seem angelic and look through a little boy eye I can see why she be married to a neer do well who be 17 year young and fool around on she Terrence Howard be bear to play these type of part he be good but I would like to see he play something different Markerson who play Nanny be also very good but for some reason the person who stand out to I be a small role play by Jeffery Wright where be this man Oscar he already win a Emmy and a Tony he be in Shaft and he steal the movie I do not even know who he be in this movie he be a chameleon never the same I never see he play a bad part yet this be a 5 minute role and he manage to make I both laugh and cry I re wind the scene few time one time because I do not know who he be his wife Carman Ejogo be excellent I have see she in role before mostly mousy stuff but she be so good here I actually know people who act just like she so it be very real to I Macy Grey who have one of the big part be also very good I be very happy that they do not kill Nanny off I think she be a goner in the beginning of the movie but she be able to go home and start her old routine of take care of people there be woman like that in most of our life People we might know or even live with thank god for they I do not know how they do it all of the time I have a friend who lose 2 child and be through a lot of stuff but whenever I be feel selfishly sorry for myself I call she and she always put I in a good mood this movie be a tribute to all of those people I only wish they they tell we what happen to some of the character like the the one armed man Paulines boyfriend who be play by one of my favorite actor on HBO s The Wire Omar Rosie Perez s character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindo s one arm man he be mesmerize in another small role,"[[19, 7, 8, 18], [12, 14, 21,

490,I be impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script Susan Sarandon play the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly give her daughter the message that they must stick together she remove her daughter from a dysfunctional but love family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood the daughter be dubious but at first she have no choice the bond with mother be pathologically strongbr br In time the girl see that the mother be off into flight of fantasy and do not have her foot on the ground she see her mother go head over heel for a handsome seductive guy who love them and leave them she see that the mother do not get it so how can she look to her mother for guidancebr br The mother direct the girl to a drama try out and see the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror be hold up to the fly by night mother this cause a period of depression and the girl be horrified at the impact on the mother and be apologetic but the lesson take holdbr br There be character growth as the mother realize her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually be persuade to let the girl go it be a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parent however emotionally dependent have to let the child go and become her own separate person,"[[8], [1, 4], [8, 12,

491,anywhere but here be not exactly anything new but the excellent performance by both of the main actress make it worth watch Sarandon and Portman be a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills California in search of a well life the main conflict come from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stay in Wisconsin with all of her friend and family and she feel that she be force to go to California with her overbear mother br br spoilers while it be true that the film as a whole be disappointingly predictable Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performance that be so good that they almost make the material seem new anywhere but here do not cover any new ground but it do have the rare quality of be able to take overuse subject matter and make it fairly interesting again also see in this movie be the most heartbreaking facial expression see in year see on Natalie Portman s face when her mother drop she off on the side of the road and she watch the car fade into the distance particularly noteworthy be the ironic subplot about Natalie s mother press she to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from

500,my one line summary hint that this be not a good film but this be not true I do enjoy the movie but be probably expect too muchbr br Adele who be solidly portray by Susan Sarandon do not come off as a very likable character she be flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree be it not for the tremendous love she have for her daughter this be the one thing she know how to do without fail Adele s daughter Anna be a sad girl who be so busy make up for her mother s shortcoming that she do not seem to be only 14 17 year old this of course make Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seem to be 14 17 year old either portman pull this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she have not be make movie for 20 year yet even with the two solid lead Wayne Wang never seem to quite draw the audience in as he do with the Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke though I have not read the book the film feel as if it have make necessary change to the story to bring it to the big screen change which may drain the emotional pungency of the story I enjoy the film for the fun of watch two wonderful actress do their work but I never get lose in the experience and I never relate to their plight,"[[12, 24], [14, 13, 4], [11, 8, 13, 4], [18, 20, 12, 12, 0, 17, 24], [7, 8, 13, 19], [19, 7, 0, 19], [19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 4], [13, 14, 19],

up unknowingly at first to Adele she grow up and become a well mother for itbr br Ann see her mother tell she she want to be an actress or so she think Adele use that crutch every time there be problem in their life we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to term between themselves and with be alone having leave their old life behindbr br The acting be top notch from both of they

508,a must see documentarythis movie have so many thing to consider while watch it it be a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid name Brenton Butler he accuse of kill a white tourist in Florida it show how the police take statement from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that kill his wife the husband seem to want to change some thing to merge with what the police say the young man be wear the police little to investigate the crime Brenton s lawyer Patrick McGuinness be meticulous in get information to help his client he tell the viewer what he think and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beating against his young client to get he to confess the camera go with McGuinness to where Brenton be question McGuinness also take picture of the room and how the audio be monitor he question a policeman on the stand and ask what the hear Brenton say to one of the investigator and he challenge their own word mcguinness investigate with Ann Finnell each place the police should have go and the thing they should have do but do not the movie show the Butlers as a loving christian family who have faith in their son s innocence and faith that God will set Brenton free they visit he in jail and pray with he there to encourage he there be scene of group prayer for Brenton the lawyer the Judge and everyone involve in this case I be a white and I be surprised to see how black in high police position treat other black it be very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think

530,first of all before I start my review I just read every review for the Muppet Movie here and I can not believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this fortunately there be only one I mean I can understand how someone may not like Star Wars due to the whole Sci fi genre but to not like a movie star some of the most lovable puppet in the history of mankind be almost sad br br Okay I will step off my soapbox now and review this moviebr br The Muppet Movie come out when I be seven all of my friend want to see this as their birthday movie so I think I see it about four time in the first month in theatersbr br As a child many thing attract I to this and all the other Muppet movie tv show the singing be probably the main one Most of the song in the Muppet Movie be classic from Rainbow Connection to I be go to go back there Someday they be entertaining and thought provokingbr br As an adult I see the Muppet Movie in almost a whole different light yes the thing that thrill I about it as a kid be still there but it be the little joke and such that be just plain hilariousbr br I mean when you think about it Jim Henson be a sick man br br Kermit be a frog and that be in love with a sweet pig that wear purple glove and could karate chop you into two piece fozzie be a stand up comedian bear Gonzo be a whatever that be infatuate with chicken then you have two old guy that heckle a piano play dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a swedish chef that you can not understand and a number of other character that be just plain eccentricbr br Yet for these reason and more Henson have entertain million of child and adult give we all something special to watch and remember he by br br The Muppet Movie will always remain in my heart for many reason but I think the big one be because it be a movie unlike a lot of recent child s movie that I feel comfortable to have my kid watch plus I do not get bore out of my mind with joke that be dumbe down to my kid

535,look back on Jim Henson s work year after his death be like take a look back into another time for unlike most so call creative type attempt to sell to or bad yet cynically exploit child nowadays Jim never seem to really forget what it be like to be a child and if there ever be a moment in which he demonstrate this Labyrinth aside it be 1979 s Muppet Movie film as an allegorical story about how Henson come to work in child s television as a puppeteer and end up with a half hour show of his own on primetime television the Muppet Movie end up an affirmation of everything more progressive understand sort would say to child who do not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s and as we enjoy the fruit of an era in which we be gag and bind from speak about anything lest someone might get offend the open celebration of difference or diversity that form a large part of the Muppet Show be on offer here I have say it in other comment but I must say it here a great light in the world go out the day Jim Henson diedbr br The Muppet Movie begin with its cast sit down to see the premiere of what be about to see for the next eighty or so minute in short precise stroke we be introduce to the major player as well as some of the minor and when the story proper begin boy be we give a great song to bring we into the moment the Rainbow Connection paint both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets especially Kermit be these be not just a bunch of feel puppet with singular personality who combine to put on a show they be live thing base upon a part of all of we only writ so much more boldly than we be use to as each Muppet be introduce to we in turn we see another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the child in the audience would respond differently to each character hence everyone have a favourite when Animal appear behind a drum kit and attempt to eat a cymbal I know I have find one of mine nowadays I be more of a Swedish Chef fan but what the heybr br complemente the character be a string of musical number that far develop their motivation and personality can you picture that share an insight into Dr Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson but the most relevant song to I be Gonzo s number ask what he be and where he come from many of we would spend a lifetime gaze into the star and like Gonzo say we know we would be go back there someday not that all the song be so deadly serious of course Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent or lack thereof and hit the road if any evidence be require that present day musician have lose the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable this number would be it never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another with the puppeteer and voice actor so perfectly on top of their game the human cast have a lot to live up tobr br which make it all the more amazing that the human element also live up to their end of the deal cameo literally pepper the film with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas pop in to offer their support even Richard Pryor the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets appear to set up a hilarious moment Mel Brooks cameo be just as disturbing to I as an adult as it be when I be a small boy but I suspect that be because Henson know why I would find it disturb now the big acting strength though come from Charles Durning who as Doc Hopper embody everything both Henson and his audience determine to resist at every junction Hopper come to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind or perhaps offer stop be the right word when Hopper s attempt to ensure Kermit s compliance become progressively more forceful and violent the whole thing be one big metaphor for how every artist have his heart break by the worldbr br of course Animal also show up to remind we that just because our friend be not sweet and cuddly do not make they any less of a friend in point of fact Animal turn out to be the good friend that Kermit have in that moment and that have be the core message of every good show or film Henson have be involve in ever since that shun or dismiss other simply because of linguistic or cosmetic difference could literally be the bad mistake one ever make there can be little doubt that in today s world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my son they be not good if they do not have good feeling for fifteen season and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authority Henson s creature workshop could never have get off the ground to misquote the album title dare to be stupid be one thing but enforce the choice upon other be another matter the Muppet Movie demonstrate how Henson dare to ask we all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box there will never be another entirely like he but he never would want we to stop tryingbr br Therefore the Muppet Movie be the epitome of a ten out of ten film if we be to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we be worth more than be obliterate this

540,I enjoy the MUPPET movie very much it be the first of the Muppet movie and be by far the good because it be so creative and fresh with later film the idea just do not seem quite so original but here we get to see Kermit and Miss Piggy ride bike an incredibly difficult scene an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun I love every minute the Muppets be perform and I would have rate the film a lot high except for one serious problem in this and most subsequent Muppet film some power that be feel there be a need to include lot of non muppet in particular many many cameo by star some work fine such as Charles Durning s but many just seem irrelevant and slow the picture to a grind halt probably the bad of they be with Edgar Bergan yes he be an amazing man who inspire Jim Henson and the rest of his crew but the tiny scene he be in just be not need nor be most of the cameo still despite this big complaint it be a great film for the entire family from the kid to even the most demanding adult,"[[8], [4, 13, 9, 14, 24], [19, 7, 4], [12, 20, 15, 15, 4, 19], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [21, 4, 17, 24], [12, 20, 2, 7], [8, 19], [1, 4], [19, 7, 4], [5, 8, 17, 18, 19], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [12, 20, 15, 15, 4, 19], [12, 14, 21, 8, 4], [0, 13, 3], [1, 4], [1, 24], [5, 0, 17], [19, 7, 4], [6, 14, 14, 3], [1, 4, 2, 0, 20, 18, 4], [8, 19], [1, 4], [18, 14], [2, 17, 4, 0, 19, 8, 21, 4], [0, 13, 3], [5, 17, 4, 18, 7], [22, 8, 19, 7], [11, 0, 19, 4, 17], [5, 8, 11, 12], [19, 7, 4], [8, 3, 4, 0], [9, 20, 18, 19], [3, 14], [13, 14, 19], [18, 4, 4, 12], [16, 20, 8, 19, 4], [18, 14], [14, 17, 8, 6, 8, 13, 0, 11], [1, 20, 19], [7, 4, 17, 4], [22, 4], [6, 4, 19], [19, 14], [18, 4, 4], [10, 4, 17, 12, 8, 19], [0, 13, 3], [12, 8, 18, 18], [15, 8, 6, 6, 24], [17, 8, 3, 4], [1, 8, 10, 4], [0, 13], [8, 13, 2, 17, 4, 3, 8, 1, 11, 24], [3, 8, 5, 5, 8, 2, 20, 11, 19], [18, 2, 4, 13, 4], [0, 13], [4, 23, 2, 4, 11, 11, 4, 13, 19], [4, 13, 18, 4, 12, 1, 11, 4], [2, 0, 18, 19], [0, 13, 3], [9, 20, 18, 19], [0], [11, 14, 19], [14, 5], [5, 20, 13], [8], [11, 14, 21, 4], [4, 21, 4, 17, 24], [12, 8, 13, 20, 19, 4], [19, 7, 4], [12, 20, 15, 15, 4, 19, 18], [1, 4], [15, 4, 17, 5, 14, 17, 12], [0, 13, 3], [8], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [7, 0, 21, 4], [17, 0, 19, 4], [19, 7, 4], [5, 8, 11, 12], [0], [11, 14, 19], [7, 8, 6, 7], [4, 23, 2, 4, 15, 19], [5, 14, 17], [14, 13, 4], [18, 4, 17, 8, 14, 20, 18], [15, 17, 14, 1, 11, 4, 12], [8, 13], [19, 7, 8, 18], [0, 13, 3], [12, 14, 18, 19], [18, 20, 1, 18, 4, 16, 20, 4, 13, 19], [12, 20, 15, 15, 4, 19], [5, 8, 11, 12], [18, 14, 12, 4], [15, 14, 22, 4, 17], [19, 7, 0, 19], [1, 4], [5, 4, 4, 11], [19, 7, 4, 17, 4], [1, 4], [0], [13, 4, 4, 3], [19, 14], [8, 13, 2, 11, 20, 3, 4], [11, 14, 19], [14, 5], [13, 14, 13], [12, 20, 15, 15, 4, 19], [8, 13], [15, 0, 17, 19, 8, 2, 20, 11, 0, 17], [12, 0, 13, 24], [12, 0, 13, 24], [2, 0, 12, 4, 14], [1, 24], [18, 19, 0, 17], [18, 14, 12, 4], [22, 14, 17, 10], [5, 8, 13, 4], [18, 20, 2, 7], [0, 18], [2, 7, 0, 17, 11, 4, 18], [3, 20, 17, 13, 8, 13, 6], [18], [1, 20, 19], [12, 0, 13, 24], [9, 20, 18, 19], [18, 4, 4, 12], [8, 17, 17, 4, 11, 4, 21, 0, 13, 19], [0, 13, 3], [18, 11, 14, 22], [19, 7, 4], [15, 8, 2, 19, 20, 17, 4], [19, 14], [0], [6, 17, 8, 13, 3], [7, 0, 11, 19], [15, 17, 14, 1, 0, 1, 11, 24], [19, 7, 4], [1, 0, 3], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4, 24], [1, 4], [22, 8, 19, 7], [4, 3, 6, 0, 17], [1, 4, 17, 6, 0, 13], [24, 4, 18], [7, 4], [1, 4], [0, 13], [0, 12, 0, 25, 8, 13, 6], [12, 0, 13], [22, 7, 14], [8, 13, 18, 15, 8, 17, 4], [9, 8, 12], [7, 4, 13, 18, 14, 13], [0, 13, 3], [19, 7, 4], [17, 4, 18, 19], [14, 5], [7, 8, 18], [2, 17, 4, 22], [1, 20, 19], [19, 7, 4], [19, 8, 13, 24], [18, 2, 4, 13, 4], [7, 4], [1, 4], [8, 13], [9, 20, 18, 19], [1, 4], [13, 14, 19], [13, 4, 4, 3], [13, 14, 17], [1, 4], [12, 14, 18, 19], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [2, 0, 12, 4, 14], [18, 19, 8, 11, 11], [3, 4, 18, 15, 8, 19, 4], [19, 7, 8, 18], [1, 8, 6], [2, 14, 12, 15, 11, 0, 8, 13, 19], [8, 19], [1, 4], [0], [6, 17, 4, 0, 19], [5, 8, 11, 12], [5, 14, 17], [19, 7, 4], [4, 13, 19, 8, 17, 4], [5, 0, 12, 8, 11, 24], [5, 17, 14, 12], [19, 7, 4], [10, 8, 3], [19, 14], [4, 21, 4, 13], [19, 7, 4], [12, 14, 18, 19], [3, 4, 12, 0, 13, 3, 8, 13, 6], [0, 3, 20, 11, 19]]"

544,if I rate the film maybe a bit high you can blame it on sentiment this be one of the first movie that I remember see and totally loving I see it at the drive in here in California in the late 70 I be already a big fan of The Muppet Show on tv so I be prime for the movie and the movie do not disappoint basically it take the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transport it from vaudeville into a road movie Kermit the Frog be on a quest to become famous not because he want to take champagne bath and ride in a private jet but because he want to make million of people happy of coursebr br Along the way he pick up all his beloved muppet friend most endearingly Fonzie Bear who he meet at a seedy bar do stand up they sing Movin right along a song that have always charm I with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and share discovery he also encounter enough Hollywood movie star to fill a Stanley Kramer movie include comedy luminary like Richard Pryor Steve Martin Edgar Bergen Milton Berle and Mel Brooks Brooks in particular have a rather dull bit and you be leave feel that Henson could have cut a few of these cameo out if he be not afraid of offend the star anyway as befit a road trip movie like this the very first person he meet be Dom DeLuisebr br The end be one of the more odd example of literally break down the 4th wall that you will find in any child s movie the Hollywood dream seem to be crumble all about they when a real rainbow pierce the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery I be sure this be mean to relate to some of Jim Henson s own personal or spiritual experiencesbr br this be the good movie with Muppets by a long shot if you or anyone else be wonder why the Muppets be so popular back in the 70 consider how poor the movie have be for the last few decade I think this film have at least aged well enough to provide a clue,"[[8, 5], [8], [17, 0, 19, 4], [19, 7, 4], [5, 8, 11, 12], [12, 0, 24, 1, 4], [0], [1, 8,

548,a bunch of full length movie feature the Muppets create by Jim Henson Co have be make but the Muppet Movie be the first one of they all and the first in the original trilogy which also feature the Great Muppet Caper and the Muppets take Manhattan it be release seven year before I be bear so I obviously do not get to see it at the time nor do I get to see its two successor when they be first release however I see a lot of the Muppets during my childhood mostly after Henson s premature death in 1990 I finally get around to see this movie for the first time around the mid ninety after hear the soundtrack unsurprisingly I like it at the time and revisit it in recent year have not exactly be disappointingbr br One day while Kermit the Frog sit in a swamp with his banjo after singe Rainbow Connection a Hollywood agent name Bernie come by in a boat and urge he to pursue a career in Tinseltown Kermit take his advice and go west he soon meet Fozzie Bear an unsuccessful stand up comedian in a restaurant and convince he to come along the frog be also notice by Doc Hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who want Kermit to be his mascot as a frog Kermit be disgust by this so he refuse and leave with Fozzie on their road trip across the country Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join they include Miss Piggy who soon become Kermit s love interest and Gonzo unfortunately as they all try to make their way to Hollywood Doc Hopper assist by Max be willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain s mascot so Kermit find himself in increase danger br br One thing many people praise this film for be the song and I can understand why there be of course the Oscar nominate Rainbow Connection at the beginning and more good tune follow such as Kermit and Fozzie s catchy road song Movin right along and I be go to go back there Someday a poignant ballad sing by Gonzo never before never again the song Miss Piggy sing when she first see Kermit be the only one I would consider rather weak and their romance seem awfully sudden the muppet in this movie be generally lovable just like they be on tv and some of they provide a lot of the humour include Fozzie make his first appearance in the film hopelessly try to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand up and well if you be familiar with these famous Muppets you should know what to expect from each of they some of the live actor who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the Insolent Waiter also it be not 100 comedy there be serious part of the film which they also do wellbr br watche this original Muppet movie again this year be my first time watch any of they since see muppet from Space one of the Muppet movie make after Henson s death release in 1999 for the first time last year I be very disappointed when I see that film which have never happen before when I watch any film or tv show feature the popular puppet character not only be that movie not very funny I also think it be a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets as I state in my review of it however I can not say I think the same of any of that movie s predecessor include this one release twenty year early the Muppet Movie seem to be the most popular of the bunch and since it have so much to like not just for kid that be understandable I highly doubt there be much left to say about The Muppet Movie that have not be say at some point in the past thirty year but today it remain good family entertainment,"[[0], [1, 20, 13, 2, 7], [14,

553,who do not love the muppet impossible it be to watch they without get some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so I guess what be important be that this movie seem to very successfully capture what make the muppet so special I do not remember much about the detail of the plot but the various moment and character in the film I recall quite fondly in fact there be quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without be self conscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly get too hang up on meticulous detail and technique the magic transcend all that other stuff tis indeed what movie be make ofbr br So how do the film achieve these thing Hmmm nice question stumped be I let us see really I feel like it be quite simple the filmmaker believe in their material and do not take themselves too seriously in the process I probably would not say the film have many truly inspire moment but it do have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movie lack a zest you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventure they also have a certain innocence about they that make they all the more endearingbr br generally I get the impression that the people that make the movie just be not afraid to try whatever feel right to they at the time which give the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lot of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personality come through the cameo be of course a bunch of nice surprise for instance maybe I do not feel I have much to say about it because I be half asleep when I see it andor as I write this review anyway I be sort of semi repeat myself here but I really like the sense of family the movie have full of love I suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia come to mind which not many film manage to achieve so effectively or effortlesslybr br And to repeat myself once more one of the film s good charm be its very relaxed and welcome atmosphere like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness be like a butterfly so the Muppet Movie greatly succeed partially by not seem to try to do so same with beauty be well undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that anyway if that sound sappy I also reckon it be pretty hilariousbr br So all in all this movie be very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it feature lot of great music highly recommend to all human both the young and the young at heart,"[[22, 7, 14], [3, 14], [13, 14, 19], [11, 14, 21, 4], [19, 7,

life on the road in his haunting I be go to go back there Someday and bad of all Kermit be continually torture and test by Doc Hopper who want he to commercialize his art for the unholy of purpose one can only wonder what Henson would have make of his family s management of the company after his death kermit himself agonize over his choice in the desert conversation scene and the final Magic Store number question whether it be all be worth it before conclude that it probably do not matter either way all this be punctuate with the expect Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful joke and of course the serious stuff would not work if it be not but the Muppet Movie be not just another jokefest as the rest of the diminish return Muppet film would become no it be a lovely gentle metaphor

566,Mikio Naruse s examination of the life of three idle constantly complain single ex geisha in post war Japan be a wonderful character piece they use to be friend in the old day but now their relationship be strain because one of the woman have become a successful moneylender and the other two owe she although the moneylender be the only one who have become successful in this rebuilding economy she be the only one of the three that have no child the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income because neither of they work complication ensue when the kid decide to get marry though not to each other and leave home this lead to the bitter grumble old woman to become even more bitter and grumbling get drunk and bemoan their rotten child and inconsiderate friend the moneylender meanwhile the moneylender be herself unhappy despite her fortune she have no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounter with two former lover from her geisha day lead nowhere all they really want be to borrow money from she the three character be all neck deep in the quicksand of their own bored life and be too weary to struggle much usually opt instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or at the very most toss complaint back and forth to each otherbr br Late Chrysanthemums be very slow move and not much actually happen but Naruse like all great director have the ability to do much with very little I have not see much of his work but I suspect that this be not his good even though it be very good the problem I think be that it all do not seem to amount to much but the film be full of good point although it be cynical it be not overly so naruse seem to sympathize with his desperate character and he paint vivid portrait that make the character seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self make misery while the film be not a must see it be important as a fragment of the work of a great little know outside of his own country director precious little of which be available on video here in the U S,"[[12, 8, 10, 8, 14], [13, 0, 17, 20, 18, 4], [18], [4, 23, 0, 12, 8, 13, 0, 19, 8, 14, 13], [14, 5], [19, 7, 4], [11,

567,for I Late Chrysanthemums be interesting not only because it be my first film of Naruse I completely enjoy but because it be technically as modern and innovative as his 30 work I have see this do not mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with breathless in 1959 but quite the oppositebr br The editing be as fluent as in the good of Hollywood film from the 30s40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regard the way he be tell his story unlike they it never purposefully accentuate anything or try to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography make I feel like I be travel on a gentle stream constantly feel the wave beneath I like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle in this sense the film be comparable to Ozu s and Mizoguchi s work but somehow even more subtlebr br What be so modern be the fact that the editing seem almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camera work in Dreyer s Ordet 1954 or Vredens dag 1943 which be reveal we a deep understanding of the film and its character rather than simply show they to usbr br I feel that Naruse s editing and cinematography be the most interesting aspect of his film elevate the story significance beyond the obvious the wonderful set and setting should not be forget either I find the story itself to be rather conventionalbr br The narrative and its character be introduce in a very interesting way and I think that the first half of the film be set up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotion and interrelation unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution be rather didactic and and formulaic compare to the set up though by itself it would have be perfectly fitting in any other less complex film somehow I feel that he fail a bit in try to dissolve the many layer he have weave maybe he should have keep they intact this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the procedure be again reminiscent to the way Ozu deal with the plot in his film unfortunately I have not yet the feeling that Naruse be able to elevate the story and its character in his film conclusion in a similarly sublime fashion the good effort I have see to date ukigumo float Clouds 1955 and Midaregumo Scattered Clouds 1967 sustain the energy he have build throughout the narrative while deliver poignant and resonant endingsbr br this be already more than most director s be able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium in this regard and consider the resonance of the last two film I have see by he he may have already become one of my favoritesbr br The only problem I have at the moment be where I be go to see more of his film on the big

certainly have produce a film that be almost of lyrical qualitybr br The film soar and swirl aerial photography Julie Andrews in motion and captivate one must just buy into the premise that Julie Andrews be a spy whose mission have go wrong overlook the tepid chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson one must believe that these be lover who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love be far more important than win war and so be maintain innocencebr br There be a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reach emotional depth often not see in comediesbr br There be wonderful comedic element foreshadow the french goon in Victor Victoria interesting diplomatic aside remind I of the Tamarind Seed see about 18 year ago and a general sense of good willbr br suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away Julie Andrews belting out of war song and the haunting whistle away the Dark be reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the striptease number like the Jenny number in Star work br br this film have like a good champagne aged well Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible the same apply to transfer the laser disk

585,I suppose I like this film as well as any I know it be not perfect but under the title the Americanization of Lily this charming and memorable semi musical satire might I suggest have be appreciate more and still love by those who recognize its special Blake edwardsproduce spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative the improbably but delightful story line follow Lili Smith a fringe type spy for the Germans in a much simple and less black and white war Lili Schmidt pass as Smith be help her Uncle who be patriotic too for Germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic lili s target be William Larrabee a charismatic US squadron leader who can supply her valuable information the plot thicken come when Lili fall in love with Larrabee have her eye open to the consequence of her playing spy and see the effect of combat on wound man at a hospital and realize what it might mean to his man whom she have meet and like she get jealous of a rival for Larrabee s affection then realize she can no long do what she have be do and give up the spy business the logical end of the film come when after the terrible WWI have end as she sing the theme song of the film wishing in a darken theater one by one the member of Larrabee s squadron appear include her lover himself indicate they have forgive she and their former opponent and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically join in the singing of it be a Long to Tipperraree to indicate all be well with the world again this be an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea write by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of John Goldfarb fame and it be a delightful narrative Larrabee s squadron include an inebriate who keep crash and other lovable type populate this lively film and the feel of this stylish and glow film be almost epic both in its scope and realization credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creation Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for set Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to Russell Harlan for his shine cinematography in the beautiful footage the principal actor be Julie Andrews as Lili Rock Hudson as Larrabee Keremy Kemp outstanding as Lili s Uncle Kurt Michael Witney Lance Percival as the inebriate pilot gorgeous Gloria Paul as Lili s stripteasing rival and many other fine actor in small part it be hard to say enough nice thing about the pace or the cleverness of the just this side of broad comedy this element be introduce by Edwards to leaven the horror of actual warfare to example the almost comic opera approach with which man make war back in a more innocent minded era of human civilization this comedy also help prepare the way for Lili s conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she be do and potentially what she may be cause this be a rare sense of life film about Lili s americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among other before tragedy can happen it be haunt I find and beautiful in many way I consider it to be Blake edwardsmasterpiece of direct and under the title the Americanization of Lili I believe with hardly any change it might have be recognize as the polished sapphire of a film it be by every standard I know,"[[8], [18, 20, 15,

for decade as an American the close thing we have to they be the New York Yankees if you be a fan then they be the great and winning team in history if you be not a fan then they be Satan s team well at least that be how it be as I grow up in Washington DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys so I be pretty sure when this film be show up north that everyone immediately have a strong emotional reaction their national sport and the close thing they have to a national team in the nhlbr br Now the cartoon itself be moderately interesting when it begin and the main character talk about grow up around Ottawa and root for the Canadians and Maurice the Rocket Richard however when his mother accidentally buy he a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and force he to wear it I know right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy this ability to connect to the character even though he live in a far off land be what make this a very special short film the way the other kid treat he and his conversation with God at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film very clever and memorable,"[[8], [22, 14, 20, 11, 3], [0, 18, 18, 20, 12, 4], [19, 7, 0, 19], [19, 7, 8, 18], [5, 8, 11, 12],

608,well I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animate short he love it and claim it be hilarious I enjoy it but do not see any humor he do not even like hockey or know anything about it and still love the story live right across the border from Canada I have watch hockey for 50 year both there and in Buffalo but I do not think much of this cartoon oh it be interesting and I know what would happen if you wear a Toronto jersey up in the Quebec area disaster that especially hold true in the glory year of Les Canadians however that do not make the story funny br br Back in the 1950 everyone in the Quebec province idolize the Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard and everyone want to be like he when his mother order a new sweater it have the Toronto Maple Leafs
