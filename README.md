# SpeechToASL

##Goal

The goal of this project is to close the gap between english speakers and people whose primary form of communication is American Sign Language (ASL). The aim is to improve accessibility across society for ASL users - across education, shopping, and employment. By having a one stop shop to convert your speech to text/ASL and to convert ASL to text/speech all in our mobile phones. 

##Description
Current version of this project is working towards converting custom audio, recorded on an iOS application, to text, then fingerspell every letter to ASL, and display on an iOS phone. 

This will serve as a base model then gradually improve to take into account flaws with the current version being worked on. Like taking into account, unique set of movements already set for some concepts. For example, signing "Good morning", typically among ASL users, they won't fingerspell or individually sign each letter, letter by letter. There is already a set of movements that is used to sign "Good morning". Another problem that will in the future be acknowledged is converting english text to proper ASL grammar before interpreting as ASL.  ASL has it's own grammar, therefore parsing english text before converting to ASL is necessary. Other ASL concepts like modulation, negation, body movement, and facial expressions will be taken into account.
